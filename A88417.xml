            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Am I a Sea, or a Whale, that thou putt'ſt,</hi> gnalai miſhmar, <hi>a priſon upon me? Job</hi> grants madneſſe in creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, and their impriſonment, upon this ground to be juſt, but ſaw not his own ſtrong diſtemper, by which he did ſo criminate Chriſt, which neither the <hi>Whale,</hi> nor the <hi>Sea,</hi> nor any creature elſe below man, doth; which was not only <hi>madneſs,</hi> but <hi>folly and madneſs, (i.)</hi> reaſon forced into more then unreaſonableneſſe.
<pb facs="tcp:113418:3"/>
Kingdomes and Nations may for their magnitude be fitly compared to <hi>Whales</hi> and <hi>Seas,</hi> and the one as eaſily as the other, doth the great God caſt into priſon when mad; and truly, thus have the Dominions of <hi>England</hi> for the generality, been a great while, and 'tis well if all our bleeding hath any whit aſſwag'd it; and therefore though wee have ſuffered much, and yet may much more, we cannot look out at the grate of our priſon, and criminate him that caſt us in. A contented perſon cannot be miſerable, no more can a contented King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Contentedneſſe hath much, when ſhe hath but a houſe over her head. A priſon-houſe is a houſe,<note n="*" place="margin">Yea, a pit is a houſe, <hi>beth habbor,</hi> Jer. 37.16.</note>although not all-out ſo well furniſhed and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated as other houſes; there is ſomething harder fare, lodging, and uſage, but yet ſome ſhelter, and ſome nouriſhment to keep life, beſide opportunities to cry out at priſon-windows, to enlarge ſhort allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and many a refreſhment comes in at windows, when dores are ſhut, and the man ſtill a priſoner. The priſon-houſe of the <hi>Whale</hi> is its own element, which leſſens much his bondage: ſo I may ſay to theſe Nations, our priſon-houſe hath been our own Land, which conſidering how ſmall 'tis, how waſting and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolating our triall, and how neer many big mouths which gape after us, is the unexpreſſible love of Chriſt: this mercy is more then all our miſery. Beſides, we have not been cloſe priſoners, we have had the liberty to cry out at our priſon windows, and have got many refreſhments from Heaven this way, in our greateſt ſtraits and hardſhips, which indeed alſo addes much to the magnitude of our mercies. Some ſtars which ſeem but ſmall, and ſcarce to twinkle with any viſible rayes at firſt looking upon, yet biggen much both in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb facs="tcp:113418:3"/>
and luſtre by a fixed eye upon them: So truly will all the mercies of Chriſt to <hi>England,</hi> in thoſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans eyes, who can ſeriouſly fix upon them. Miſery look't upon as mixed with mercy, is as courſe earth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid with precious Ore, very delightfull and gainfull; but otherwiſe lookt on, it imbitters and worſens thoſe on whom it is; of which great evill, <hi>England,</hi> take heed. Many now complain much of bad times, which ſhould amongſt Chriſtians, have a Chriſtian conſtruction: but to ſpeak properly in this point, times are bad only to bad hearts, and unto them indeed they are very bad. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have worſen'd very much (I grant) in theſe few yeers of Gods heavie hand upon us, more, I think, then in many yeers before; thouſands look now very black in the face, as neer death, wrath, and cutting off, which lookt but a little while ago, as Cedars in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and as if they would have liv'd a long life, even life for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more. From <hi>marad,</hi> which ſignifies to rebell, comes <hi>marud,</hi> which ſignifies poor, afflicted, caſt out. They which rebell under the hand of God, againſt the will and wayes of God, may talk and vaunt of impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, afflicting, and caſting out others, but Chriſt will bring all theſe upon them. The trialls which were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>England</hi> in the Biſhops time, occaſioned many apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, ſo have thoſe which have been lately upon us, between the King and Parliament, which generation of men, are the ſharpeſt ſwords to kill a Land:<note n="*" place="margin">When changes in a kingdome, make <hi>change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> (i.) from Chriſt, ſo the <hi>Hebrews</hi> call an Apoſtate.

But though theſe priſons were bad, yet thoſe are far worſe which wreſt and turn the ſoules of men out of joynt, <hi>(i.)</hi> further off from Chriſt and his will, then they were before; and yet ſo hath thy priſon, poor <hi>England,</hi> done to many. Such ſad events of Gods hand, call every heart in his place, to be a faithfull watch-man; to be more then <hi>vigilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> to be <gap reason="foreign">

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Was a very Chriſtian expreſsion, that once a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Learned and worthy friend (of another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of another judgement to mine own) wrote unto me: <hi>Sir, though there be two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions between us, yet I deſire there may be but one heart;</hi> to which my deſire doth ſo concur, that my requeſts to Chriſt are, that this Spirit may be powred out amongst all his people, in all the world. There are many, and (I think) too many opinions amongst the godly already, but if there were as many more, I hope I ſhould be one in heart with them all, which are in Chriſt, and walk in him. Variety of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is not an affliction, but matter of much admiration to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to ſuch as are but humanely ingenious: So truly, varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of judgements, ſimply conſidered, is not a grief, but a glory to me to behold, when one Spirit of grace and heavenlineſſe is in them all; for I account it a glaſſe of Gods own making, wherein to behold his <hi>manifold Wiſdome;</hi> and I further think, that he is ſetting many nobler ſpirits then mine own at work, to dig up ſome pearle and precious truth for me, which yet I have not. I differ, <hi>Reader,</hi> with none, but them that differ with Chriſt. As for them that vary in judgement from me, whoſe lives are holy, I am jealous that they are better acquainted with Chriſt then I, and ſo I lay my hand on my mouth, and leave them alone to their Maſter and mine, believing that we are as <hi>Laban</hi> ſaid to <hi>Jacob,</hi>

Our light is ſo dark, that a man, a Chriſtian man is hid from his Chriſtian friend, in matter of judgement, but there is a <hi>Mitſpah,</hi> one God watching between us both, which will bring us to ſee one another, and himſelf plainly in heaven.

Let this be my Apologie for my ſpirit and opinion, to thee, <hi>Chriſtian Reader,</hi> and to all the people of God, that ſo Satan by no ſpirit of prejudice hinder the profitable participation of this work, which ſpeaks of no controverſie between Chriſtian and Chriſtian, betweeen King and Parliament, or between man and man, but of that controverſie which is between God and (I fear) all men in theſe Dominions under which we are; and how this controverſie will end, give him that loves Chriſt and thee, leave longer yet to ſtudy and pray ere he give thee in an anſwer under his hand. As for errata's, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Scribe, and Preſſe, are too full, there need the leſſe in the <hi>Reader,</hi> or elſe things will be too bad. A childe wrote from Chriſts mouth, and another from mine, which truly I had hardly eaſe or life to overlook; and then, when to be printed, as haſty in this (by other hands, I cannot ſay by other ends then mine own, for the undertaker I take to be truly godly) as ſlow in the finiſhing of it: three Preſſes were employed at once, two in the City, one in the Countrey, and he hardly one, that ſhould review them; ſo that doubtleſſe, many things will diſpleaſe others more then my ſelfe, who expect to ſuffer much in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and printing, by them that have little in them; and as for others, they will be candid, noble, and do like them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, take in good part, parts and fragments of him whom they honour more then I</p>

               <p>Deliverance undergoes a double acceptation; it means tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall deliverance ſometimes: <hi>Attend unto my cry, for I am brought very low: deliver me from my perſecutours, for they are ſtronger then I,</hi> Pſal. 142.6. Sometimes it means eternall deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, ſoul-ſalvation, deliverance from ſinne it ſelf and the dominion of it, and not barely from ſuch domineering evils as ſinne ſets up to make this life miſerable: <hi>Deliver me from all my tranſgreſſions,</hi> Pſal. 39.8. <hi>Deliver me from bloud-guiltineſſe,</hi> Pſal. 51.14. Theſe expreſſions ſpeak ſoul-deliverance, eternall deliverance; and of this nature is that deliverance here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in my Text, as the words themſelves explain.</p>

Corruption is got into the bloud, generation is marred, man the nobleſt creature cannot beget a happy creature; when he goes about this work, he layes the firſt foundation in ſinne. <hi>In ſinne was I conceived, &amp;c.</hi> David was marred from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and made miſerable as ſoon as <hi>crudled in the wombe,</hi> as ſoon as any matter was laid together for ſuch a form. Treaſon ſtains the bloud; the firſt man proves a traytour, and never ſince any otherwiſe, but one. The firſt man poiſoned his nature, and then begat as he made himſelf, and not as God made him, and ſo doth all the poſterity to this houre; and this makes ſo many men, ſo many worms and no men; ſo many baſe miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, and not one worthy of the name of a bleſſed crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but the name of an uncreated thing, a piece of mere putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, <hi>a worm,</hi> ſo in body, and ſo in ſoul, mere putrifaction in all.</p>

Unbelief hath ſhut up all, and that's a ſoul-plague, and yet the plague of all (ſaith the Apoſtle) Jews and Gentiles. The whole world is ſhut up in ſinne and miſery, and needs a deliverance: what a great goal is one ſinne become! a gangrene keeps not at one part, it runs over all: <hi>There were many lepers in Iſrael,</hi> (ſaith the prophet) and he alſo ſaith, there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny widows; but I cannot ſay of this world, that there are many lepers and many widows, but all are lepers and widows, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>married creatures to Chriſt, not one good: <hi>Who can ſay his heart is clean?</hi> Prov. 20.9. There is a plague of the body, but that is not every ones plague; but there is a plague of the heart, and that is every ones plague: there are mortall diſeaſes upon the immortall ſouls of all, and the expreſſion in the Text here ſpeaks it plain, <hi>Who hath delivered [us] from the power of darkneſſe,</hi> who hath taken us out of the common deluge.</p>

                  </label> The truth is plain before you, man is in ſoul-miſery, he needs a ſoul-deliverance. Apply this point to your ſelves, are you ſenſible of the truth of it? do you ſet your ſelves to work an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably? Bodily miſery begins to creep towards you, and you are very ſenſible of this; bloud and wounds are like to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to catch hold of every one, and every ones fleſh ſhakes. O what miſery are we in, ſaith one! and what miſery are we in, ſaith another! yea, but what miſery is thy ſoul in, art thou ſenſible of that? doſt thou feel that plague of plagues, that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery within, which hath made all ſo miſerable without? Bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſery is but to make ſenſible of ſoul-miſery; 'tis Gods pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the rope without, to make the bell ſpeak within, (and 'tis many thouſand mens unhappineſſe, that they conſider not this,) and it comes as the laſt means to do this. The ſunne ſhines a great while, as the onely kind means to open mens eyes, and to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113418:7"/>
bring them to ſee their ſtate; but when this will not do, the ſunne ſets, and darkneſſe comes in the place thereof, that is, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery and calamity, to beat open theſe doors which love could not unlock. Look about thee England, thy laſt remedie is upon thee to make thee good, to make thee know thy lukewarmneſſe, thy ſettledneſſe upon thy lees, thy ſoul-miſery. Thou beginneſt to grow very poore in temporalls, doſt thou yet begin to ſee that thou art poore in ſpiritualls? Thou beginneſt to be made naked in body, doſt thou yet begin to ſee thy ſoul-nakedneſſe; what a poore, blind, wretched, and naked Church thou art? what a pitifull ſoul thou haſt? Biſhops <hi>may be,</hi> and Common Prayer book <hi>may be,</hi> and this and that unwarranted thing <hi>may be</hi> in Gods worſhip; ſuch language as this ſpeaks how ſoul-miſerable thou art ſtill.</p>
               <p>But I will not be ſo generall in the application of this point, I will ſpeak particularly to you. In the night owls eyes are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and they ſee: 'Tis night now in England, and very dark; ye blind creatures are your eyes open? do you yet ſee any thing that belongs to your ſouls? doth <hi>ſinne revive</hi> now things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out are kill'd? your iniquity hath found ye out, have you found out it? Can you lay your hand on your heart, and ſay, Here's that iniquity that hath made a kingdome bleed, my family deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, undone me and mine? Paul when the Law was preached to him, ſinne revived and he died, in the conſideration of his wretched condition. God preaches Law now all the kingdome over, becauſe Goſpel will do no good; doth ſinne revive now, and can you ſee the wretched ſtate of your ſouls? When the ſonnes of Jacob were caſt into bodily miſery, then their ſoul-miſery came to ſight, what they had done to their brother Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph, and they could lay their hand diſtinctly upon that within which brought ſo much miſery without upon them. When ponds are ſtirred, and water let out, then frogs and toads ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and we ſee what uggly things they are: Thus hath God dealt with many of you Londoners; you had great eſtates like great deep ponds, and now God hath let out all almoſt, that you may ſee what mud, toads and frogs are at the bottome of it in your ſouls, with what hearts ye got and kept your wealth: do you ſee any uggly creatures yet ſtirre in your ſouls? ye are
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:113418:7"/>
almoſt, I think, ſome of you, in Joſephs brethrens caſe, ready to ſtarve for want of bread: Can you now like them tell that within, which hath made ſuch clean work without, which hath clean'd your teeth and your ſtates? Senſibility of ſoul-miſery is the thing that is driven at in all this.</p>
               <p>The man that complains not of ſoul-miſery amongſt all other miſeries he undergoes, I am afraid is not ſenſible of the main evil upon him. Where there is a new man and an old in one heart, there is a perpetuall warre, and this very ſenſible, <hi>I find a law in my members rebelling againſt the law of my mind.</hi> That which will be death to the ſoul, is death to it, and the ſoul groans under it as in the pangs of death: <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Corruption according to its qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and according to its quantity, a ſoul ſenſible of its ſtate, is ſenſible of both; what corrupt bloud is in him, and how much, and how it runs up and down in every vein, and pricks as it goes; and no Phyſician like him that can do good to this diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed body, <hi>Who ſhall deliver me from this body of death?</hi> What a burthen corruption is to you, in the body of it, and in the branches of it, and what a death it makes to your life; what a bleſſing deſired is Chriſt, and what pantings daily about theſe things you know: there is no way like this to find out what ſoul-ſenſibilitie is in you.</p>
               <p>Conſider theſe things, and as you find your ſelves indeed ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of ſoul-miſery; ſhew it every one of you, by ſeeking deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from it, it ſhould be all your work, what elſe in this world have you to do? 'Tis an imployment for life, for all, to get our ſouls out of ſinne, and into Chriſt; and yet ſome of you make it a work by ſtarts, and marre all, ſink your ſouls lower, whilſt you give but a half lift, that is, lift and let fall again: the devill a little ſtirred, and not caſt out, takes ſtronger hold.</p>
               <p>Know your work, and know your time; know this time; You are not like to die the common death of all men, Gods ſore judgements are abroad: you may have your throats cut quickly, in your beds, and how ſad will it be when bloud ſhall touch bloud, a body in bloud touch a ſoul in bloud: this will be a bloudy ſight indeed. Sinners, me thinks you do not ſtirre as if juſtice were near you, there is killing and ſlaying
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:113418:8"/>
round about us, and we in the midſt of all are aſleep: is not your bloudy cloud gathering too? There is a great crie of peace, and I think God means no ſuch thing yet: ſinners, take heed juſtice doth not ſeize on your ſouls, ere you know them, or it. You are making bulworks and forts to deliver your bodies, but what do you do to deliver your ſouls? You would not have your bodies kild, and your ſouls are ſlain already, and ſtink ſo that God cannot indure them: do you think that your bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works will be any defence for ſuch bodies, as have ſuch ſouls in them? Will not the juſtice of God beat down all, to take her prey and ſeize upon malignants? You have more malignants in the citie then you are aware of: you have a great deal of malignancy in your ſouls, and this will betray you all if you look not to it; there are many of you deſperate malignants to God, which yet are not ſo to the Parliament. What ſouls you have, and what the condition of them is, look to it, and work out ſalvation for them with fear and trembling, I will not give a ruſh elſe for all your forts to defend you; juſtice will break through ſtone-walls, and mud-walls, and through all, through your fleſh and through your bones, till it come into the very ſpring of ſinne, which is your ſouls, &amp; there it will lie burning for ever, as things when they are at their center, there reſt. The ſoul is the center of ſinne and wrath, and wrath will to its cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do what you can, and make what fortifications you can, if your ſouls be not delivered and ſaved from that wretched condition wherein naturally they are.</p>

                  <hi>Chriſt ſnatcheth ſouls out of hell fire:</hi> the metaphor is uſed highly to adorn the love of Chriſt, in his motion towards miſerable man, and it doth it indeed gloriouſly, as it may be I may ſet forth to you in ſeverall particulars, and all within the compaſſe of the metaphor.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt moves ſtrongly to ſave; Snatching ſpeaks an act of force; Chriſt overturns all that ſtands in his way when he puts forth to deliver a ſoul: omnipotence ſtretcheth forth his arm in this work, devils tremble, iniquitie is ſubdued, captivitie car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried captive, the ſoul in the midſt of violence, violently reſcued. The Lion of the tribe of Judah moves to ſave as a lion ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, terribly, none can reſiſt his will, ſinners, devils, nor men, <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> Which way the will of God moves, power irreſiſtable ſeconds, he drives all before him, and takes his prey, to wit, the poore ſoul that is preyd upon. Two Lions contend about the ſoul of man, the Lion of the tribe of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, and that roaring Lion you reade of in Peter. The Lion of the tribe of Judah is too ſtrong for that Lion, and ſnatcheth the prey out of the devils mouth, <hi>Who hath ſnatched us out of the power of darkneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt moves ſwiftly to ſave: Snatching notes ſwift mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Power puts forth in order to miſerie, there is but a ſtep between hell and that ſoul that is under the power of darkneſſe, what therefore is done muſt be done ſpeedily, or the ſoul is loſt. Chriſt is a <hi>preſent help,</hi> he moves <hi>as a Roe,</hi> as a <hi>young Roe,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſwiftly to apply remedie to miſerable man. <hi>My beloved is like a Roe or a young hart, behold he ſtandeth behind our wall, ſhewing himſelf through the lattice,</hi> Canticles 2.9. When the devil hath the ſoul in his arms, Chriſt is behind him, as the ſpouſe ſpeaks, he is behind our walls, at hand when Sathan aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, and makes him let go his hold. The devil doth not bite gently, nor pull weakly; remedy therefore muſt be ſwift in this caſe, or elſe no remedie; the ſoul quickly dyes with deep wounds. Poiſon is of differing ſtrength, ſome kills ſuddenly and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all the devils poiſon doth ſo, if not overruled in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113418:9"/>
an antidote is anſwerably applyed; and upon this ground the Church ſo prayes, <hi>Make haſte my beloved, and be like to a Roe, the companions hearken to thy voice, make me to hear it.</hi> Some creatures take their game gently: Spannels take a duck and bite not deadly, but the devil is not ſuch a dog, when he bites he bites deadly quickly, and therefore doth Chriſt ſnatch out of his mouth before all be deſperate and paſt remedie.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt moves throughly to ſave. Snatching out of the power of darkneſſe, 'tis an expreſſion that ſpeaks a full and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall aſſuming that which was fully and wholly anothers; it notes a taking out of the devils arms into Chriſts arms, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall ſurpriſe. Chriſt fights for his wife, as Samſon and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid did, he catches his ſpouſe out of the devils arms, and then ſhe becomes intire his. Chriſts ſpouſe is no harlot, ſhe doth not lie embraced between two, the ſoul lies not in the boſome of ſinne which Chriſt hath catched. Snatching from another varies not the proprietie with us, but ſuch a catching of a thing as is made in and by warre, doth; what I ſnatch or catch from my enemy in warre is wholly mine own. Chriſt gets every ſoul by the ſword, by the ſword of the ſpirit, what he takes out of the devils kingdome, he takes by warre, and the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etie is varied. What was not his is his, they that were not his people now are, they are his in the quality and propertie of the thing. They are catched by the heart whom Chriſt catches, that catched and all is catched; the captive now acknowledges the arms that overcame him, and ſtirres not from the power of theſe arms, neither can be taken again. Chriſt takes often out of the devils hand but the devil nor no inſtrument of his can ſnatch out of Chriſts hand; Chriſt keeps all he catches as wholly his. Whatſoever lies wrapt up in this term <hi>(us)</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle the devil hath loſt, and Chriſt hath catched. <hi>Who hath catched us out of the power of darkneſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt moves preventingly in the ſalvation of man; catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpeaks an act unthought of, force ſurpriſing, the ſurpriſed dreaming nothing. Chriſt catcheth ſinners aſleep in a dead ſleep; ſouldiers are ſometimes ſo catched, the devils ſouldiers are all ſo catched. Corruption was another life in Saul, he did <hi>breath out ſlaughter,</hi> he did move in ſinne in foul ſinne with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:113418:9"/>
no more pain then you breathe, ſo ſecure and ſenſeleſſe; and in this condition catched, ſurpriſed, and knocked down utterly unawares. Many a ſinner hath confeſt this way of Chriſt; I went to hear ſuch a one and thought nothing, and was catched, my heart convinced and overcome, which before never cared for the word of God. Chriſt comes behind ſinners, and ere they are aware ſeiſeth upon them: <hi>Ye ſhall hear a voice behind ye,</hi> ſaith God. <hi>I was found of them that ſought me not.</hi> Chriſt comes to every carnall ſoul before ſent for, but brings his ſtool with him, and makes his own welcome; he catches no ſoul, but that ſoul is as much caught with him ere he leavs him, <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is come to thine houſe,</hi> ſaid Chriſt. Chriſt comes before ſent for, he takes every ſinner before up, and before ready, and helps him up, and makes him ready; waſhes him face and hands and heart, &amp; puts on clean raiment. The devils ſouldiers are all ſleepie, and keep no watch: <hi>Yet a little more folding the hands,</hi> this is every ſinners tone when Chriſt comes. No ſaith Chriſt, no more ſleeping now O ſoul, the voice of the turtle is heard, <hi>I have gathered my myrrhe with my ſpice, I have eaten my hony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb with my hony, I have drunk my wine with my milk.</hi> Come away dear ſoul, come away: unaware ſuch a ſweet voice is heard behind a man, and the man is catched, and cannot withſtand it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Chriſt moves raviſhingly: Caught ſounds ſo much in my eare. Chriſts way of ſalvation is a raviſhing way: na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe is diſcovered, and glory is apparrell preſented, with this ſweet language, Sinner wilt thou wear it? I freely give it to thee. This is love ſmiling, and the ſoul is taken: Sinne made burthenſome, and ſhoulders preſented, an able porter to bear it: this is the manner of Chriſts motion towards miſerable man, and 'tis taking and raviſhing; <hi>Know thy nakedneſſe, and buy of me:</hi> great deformitie is diſcovered, and abſolute beautie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, ſouls fall ſick of love upon this, and are they not catched now indeed out of the power of ſinne which did ſo pleaſe? Light appears to him that ſaw none, and 'tis ſo glorious, ſo tranſcendently pleaſant, that the ſoul can indure darkneſſe no more, and is not this ſoul catched out of the power of darknes? Catching ſpeaks a double power, active or paſſive, by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113418:10"/>
of a thing, or by the quality of a thing, and Chriſt takes both wayes. The ſweetneſſe of Chriſt overcomes frovvard ſouls. There be fingers put out to ſinners, &amp; theſe fingers drop myrrhe, and that takes ſouls; Chriſt doth bemyrrhe his motion: naked motion vvould not take: his ointments have their odour: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the odour of thy ointments, therefore the virgins love thee.</hi>

                  </label> It is a great time of catching and taking of all hands. Who hath catched your ſouls? Chriſt or the devil? I do not knovv vvhat ſouls you have, nor in vvhoſe hands they are, but you ſhould, or elſe vvo unto you: if your ſouls be in the hands of any but Chriſt, you are loſt men.

Sathan preys upon poore ſouls, and yet none com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, to be pulld out of his pavvs; the roring lion goes up and dovvn devouring, and do you heare any noiſe, ſhrieking and crying out, as if there vvere any ſuch ſoul-devouring beaſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or any in his pavvs? There is bodily ſenſe ſince the fall, but no ſoul-ſenſe; you vvill not let your Prince do vvhat he vvill vvith your bodies; you vvill fight and die rather; and yet you vvill let the prince of darkneſſe do vvhat he vvill vvith your ſouls, enſlave them, and <hi>lead them captive at his will,</hi> rend and tear them, and yet the devill is no tyrant vvith you; not a petition preferred in point of ſoul-ſlavery (I doubt) all this Parliament time, to the great State above.</p>
               <p>Sinners have you no ſouls? Yes. Where be they? vvho hath them? Chriſt or the devill? Chriſt. This ſhould be experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to us to do vvell. Whom Chriſt hath ſnatched out of the devils povver, they admire him; the perſon is very beautifull that redeems the ſoul. Hovv beautifull vvas David as a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Iſrael from Goliah! Heaven and earth rang what a man he was. Much more beautifull is a ſoul-redeemer; <hi>Who is this that cometh from Edom, with died garments from Bozra? this that is glorious in his apparrell, travelling in the greatneſſe of his ſtrength? I that ſpeak in righteouſneſſe, mighty to ſave,</hi> Eſa. 63.1. Great things unlooked for amaze, <hi>Who is this that comes from Edom?</hi> Did I ever imploy Chriſt to take me out of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:113418:10"/>
the hands of the devill, and yet he came and did it? Was I not his enemy and yet he became my friend! Was not my ſoul an abſtract of evil, <hi>enmitie,</hi> dirt, and not dirtie, and yet in a ſink he came and poured out love! Here the ſoul dwells and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires. <hi>Glorious in apparell,</hi> &amp;c. Inſide and outſide of him that redeems, are glorious to the redeemed. Chriſts ſpirit is firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired that he would come, and then his outſide admired; all that that he brings with him to manage ſuch a ſpirit and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, the apparrelling of his will, is red and glorious: heart, hand, head of the redeemer, all is glorious in the eye of the redeemed. That Chriſt would die his outſide red with his inſide, his skin ſcarlet-coloured with his heartbloud for me, what glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell is this! That a Lamb would incounter with a Lion, and ſurfet him with his own bloud for a prey, to make him let me go out of his pawes; who is that Lamb, and what is my ſoul that ſuch a deadly fieght ſhould be made to ſave it! O my ſoul is not the price of bloud upon thee? is not thy nakedneſſe co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with ſcarlet of ſuch price as puts a God in debt?</p>
               <p>The redeemed adore the redeemer: this is in the text, <hi>Giving thanks to the Father who hath delivered us from the power of death,</hi> &amp;c. a redeemed ſoul feeds two with every mercy, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and God; he admires love, this is feeding himſelf; and then he praiſeth God, and this is feeding of God too. Paul could not ſpeak about ſoul-deliverance, but he muſt make a breaking off and a breaking out, <hi>Who ſhall deliver me? I thank God, Chriſt.</hi> The ſoul is naturally active, but as 'tis freed by Chriſt 'tis much more active and aſcending, it ſends to God all that is done upon it: The ſoul bleſſes neceſſarily as 'tis bleſſed. Soul-bleſſings make their qualitie in us ſuitable to themſelves, and to their own nature; ſo much of God as they bring with them, ſo much of God they leave in the ſoul, and the ſoul neceſſarily carries as much of God to Heaven as it hath of God from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in any mercy. In the Devils arms there is ſinging; drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards ſing, and worldlings ſing. In Chriſts armes there is ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too, there is ſinging of halelujahs, here the redeemed lift up the Redeemer; every ſoul in Chriſts arms ſings to him: all Chriſts children can ſing ſweetly: there are ſongs of Sion, ſongs of deliverance. Divine love makes gladneſſe of heart, a heart
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:113418:11"/>
gladded gets into that boſome that made it ſo, to dilate it ſelf, and that makes more gladneſſe. A redeemed ſoul is every day more admiring &amp; more praiſing him that redeemed him then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So many ſouls ſnatched out of hell, ſo many ſweet inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of melody hath Chriſt in this world. Chriſt glorifies to be glorified; not a ſoul that Chriſt pulls out of the devils mouth but he is like Jonah when he came out of the belly of hell, a humble relater of wonderfull things to God and man. All that Chriſt takes out of the devils boſome and ſets in his own, ſtroke him and kiſſe him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The redeemed obey their redeemer. Not a lambe taken out of the power of the wolf but follows the ſhepheard, <hi>Your obedience is come abroad unto all,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Whom Chriſt takes, they become followers of him in the ſight of all. Redemption from the power of Sathan and the power of ſinne are the ſame; redeemed ſouls are out of both, and obey neither, they onely obſerve him that hath taken them; <hi>I will run the waies of thy commandments when thou haſt ſet my heart at liberty,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. He ſpeaks as a captive ſet at libertie that was glad of his legs, and obſerve what wayes he takes to runne in, <hi>I will runne the wayes of thy commandments.</hi> The ſoul ſtill is in behaviour as the power under which it is; if under the power of ſinne, it walks ſinnefully; if under the power of Chriſt, it walks holily in his commandments. The ſoul is ſtill according to the hand in which it is: would you know in whoſe hand and power you are? obſerve well then of what behaviour your ſouls are. Sinners you wallow in your luſts, and live according to the power of your corruption, and yet many of you plead and glory in your redemption by Chriſt. Your heart gives your tongue the lie, and your life ſpeaks you ſlaves to the devil and your luſts. Is it a ſmall thing to you to belie Chriſt and belie your ſouls? to diſtract and make void divine redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption? Are your ſouls redeemed, and yet are they in ſlavery to ſinne?</p>
               <p>Acknowledge truth that diſcovers you, and confeſſe your ſad ſtate, this would better become you. A bad ſtate is remedileſſe whileſt 'tis plead for as good: the wicked may juſtifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but God juſtifies none; it will be double death to juſtifie
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:113418:11"/>
that which God and conſcience condemn. Sinners, you cut off your ſouls from grace by wicked confidence; God does nothing for the man that thinks all is well, but prepare double miſerie for calling evill good. As corruption is in ſtrength, let every ſoul complain, <hi>O wretched man that I am,</hi> &amp;c. Corruption makes wretchedneſſe, according to its ſtrength, in every ſoul, for as luſt lives it miſleads; ſinne will beare ſway where 'tis not thruſt out; the old man is not as ſome old men that ſit ſtill and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but is very ſtirring; corruption as it lives is imperious, all muſt be her ſervants, gifts, parts, yea the very heart. Luſt as it lives will bewitch your affection, adulterate your judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, creep into your boſome, and become your full delight, then are you wretched ſouls indeed, then are you galley-ſlaves. Sinners conſider this point; corruption as it is in ſtrength, keeps its propertie in all, the beſt of you all will find the devils hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a hell, Ah Lord, what will his hell be then? You will be weary of your lives, as luſt lives in you, 'tis ſuch a bondage, make what ſweet out of it you can; the more artificiall you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in acting and managing corruption, the more power it hath in you, and the ſooner will it kill all your felicitie dead; you will ſuddenly in the flame of luſt cry out, as that Martyr in a flame of fire, in an other caſe, Hell is come, is come, Sathan is come, is come, as he cried out, Chriſt is come, is come.</p>
               <p>We may releive our ſelves from this point too, reſpecting this land. If power work irriſiſtablie to ſave the ſoul, the ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body is much more eaſie to it. One devil is more ſtrong then all the wicked men in England, and yet the power which oppoſeth him about the ſoul, which he moſt looks at, and contends for, is too hard for him. Fearfull ſouls, be ſtrong, you will ſee irreſiſtable power ſnatch poore England, as a brand out of the fire. Power it ſelf, as irreſiſtable, ſhould releive, and as it hath ſuch a propertie, and ſo works, ſnatching creatures when almoſt ready to be deſtroyed; this ſhould much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive and raiſe the heart. Were we much lower then we are, yet irreſiſtable power can put forth of a ſudden, and ſnatch us out of the mouth of lions, and 'tis its propertie ſo to do. You are left now to fetch in your relief from God onely, ſtrike in to do it, as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113418:12"/>
you behold any propertie of any divine attribute to put forth it ſelf. Now you heare that this is the propertie of divine power, to work irreſiſtably,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Redemptio à nihilo que dam creatio est.</hi> Means are ſtill enough to that power which is abſolute.</note> and to work ſo of a ſudden, <hi>to ſnatch</hi> out of miſerie when all is ready to be ſwallowed up; feed your weak ſouls with this, and move at the throne of grace upon it, and ſurely you will heare of God, and England will be raiſed from the duſt, and have beauty for aſhes: <hi>Before your pots can feel the thorns he ſhall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath: And the righteous ſhall ſee this and joy,</hi> &amp;c. Pſalme 58.9.10. <hi>Both living, and in his wrath,</hi> as living as his wrath, is the originall; like that expreſſion uſed of Chora and his company, who went down <hi>quick into the pit,</hi> as living as the wrath of God that took them off. There is ſnatching of wicked into hell, as well as ſnatching of believers into Heaven.</p>

                  </label> To the dark Church of England I will ſpeak a word from this point: Thy darkneſſe hath made looſneſſe, and lawleſneſſe bloudy deſperate gentiliſme and heatheniſme; thy children are riſen up againſt thee to kill thee, for keeping them without light. O Engliſh earth, drink not up the bloud of thy ſlain; take the bloud of thy body, and the bloud of thy ſoul, and throw it in the face of Biſhops, Deans, Prebends, Parſons, Vicars, Curats, and all of that kind, which have and do keep thee in blindneſſe, and taught thy children to kill Chriſt, and one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. For ſome years together looſneſſe in tenets, looſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines and pamphlets filled the kingdome, directed againſt the Sabbath, and other main parts of Chriſts will: Prelates brains hatched nothing but toads, they crept out of their mouths all the land over, and then I did ſadly foreſee what all was drawing too apace; looſe tenets make a looſe life. When I ſaw mens gifts and parts under the power of darkneſſe, I did
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:113418:13"/>
believe that their perſons and fortunes would not be long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; toads and ſerpents when they are generated muſt live, who ever be ſtung and poiſoned to death. Unhappy Prelates! muſt England bleed and die rather then your pompe? all her bloud yet cries againſt this generation. Was not this the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of that company of men (I would not have them now imitated by any other) to throw down light every where, and keep the kingdome in darkneſſe, and ſo in looſneſſe, that every one might riſe up one againſt another to accompliſh their will, even children againſt father, to cut the throat of purity and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans through the land?</p>
               <p>To you more particularly let me ſpeak from this point: See here the ſpring of your neutrality, you are dark; you can do any thing becauſe you know nothing. Truth hath the power of God in it; your hearts bend any way, becauſe you cannot ſet up God before them: Sinners, how have ye heard? and what have you learn'd? Your courſe ſpeaks you looſe to Chriſt, and to many Chriſtians, what does it to your own conſciences? Have ye light? what, and live looſely? Then you withhold the truth of God in unrighteouſneſſe, and you will ſuffer doubly, namely for the abuſe of light and conſcience. A Libertine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt light fights deſperately againſt conſcience, or elſe hath kill'd it quite. God is very angry with a man that is a ſinner in the day. <hi>O that thou hadſt known in this thy day:</hi> ſinners in the day provoke God much, and will be beaten with many ſtripes. The prophet Eſay ſpeaks of <hi>darkning light in the heavens thereof,</hi> Eſay 5, 30. Libertines againſt light, darken the ſunne in the heavens thereof; they can ſnuff out the ſunne that ſhines in their ſouls, as one ſnuffs out a candle, they pull the ſunne out of heaven, to make pleaſure to themſelves in the dark, and make as if they knew nothing, what they do. Your hypocriſie is reigning, and if not lookt to, twill be ruining quickly; theſe do not periſh for want of knowledge, but for want of conſcience.</p>

The bearing up of the world, is not ſo much burthen, as the bearing up the ſoul of man, he does the one with his word, but to the doing of the other, goeth word, perſon, bodie, ſoul, arms, ſhoulders, heart, bloud, all; and yet Chriſt ſubmits all theſe, and becomes a porter, a ſervant, a ſlave, and bears till his back and and heart break. Labour if honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, helps to bear it ſelf, the labour it ſelf lends one ſhoulders, and gives one legges; but baſe labour loads it ſelf, the ſervility and baſeneſſe of it is more burthen then the burthen, and pulls away all ſhoulders from it; who will put himſelf to drudgings, baſe ſervice, that is of any qualitie? And yet Chriſt did this. Drowning waters are up in this low world, and Chriſt ſtrips himſelf, and wades, and carries over poore ſouls upon his back, and weaklings in his arms, ſome one way, and ſome another, as may be beſt eaſe to them, though moſt pain to him.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Chriſt ſaves fatherly. Parents know no pains nor coſt for children; knees, arms, boſome, ſoul, all open to bear them. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob wrapt up Joſeph in his ſoul, and carried him up and down
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113418:15"/>
in his boſome: Chriſt is a father, and moves juſt ſo to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; for every one of his children is a Joſeph to him: he takes up a child when complaining like the Shunamite, and ſets him in his lappe, and keeps him their till he die; all Chriſts children die in his arms, like the Shunamites ſonne. If a child of God live an hundred years, his father never ſets him down out of his arms, but carries him unto death, beyond death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks. Chriſt wraps us up in his ſoul, and carries us there alwayes, <hi>he is ever mindfull of us.</hi> You have that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Scripture; we are but trifles and yet Chriſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put theſe trifles out of his mind; he carries our ſouls, as he carries his own thoughts, <hi>he minds us,</hi> up and down the world, till we come home. Compaſſion is, when things are laid to heart, and ſo carried up and down; and they are choicely carried indeed, which are ſo carried. Compaſſion carries Chriſt and us; compaſſion gathers about his heart, and that gathers his children about there too, and ſo they are bound up together in that bundle of life, and carried through ſinne and miſerie, to eternall felicitie, into his kingdome.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaves ſurely: a father bears over his children, to make ſure work, that they may not fall in. Between nature and grace is a great gulf, and a remove from one to the other, is not without great danger; ſoul tranſaction from corruption to grace, is with perpetuall fierce conflict; the ſoul cannot put out a ſtep for heaven, but Sathan lets fly at it, and Chriſt therefore is a convoy, and he transferres from ſinne to grace, and from hell to heaven. As tranſactions of ſtate removing this and that, have their bloudy conteſts: ſo tranſaction of that great State, for eternity within, pulling down and ſetting up, have deadly conteſt, and the ſoul will be killed in the way to heaven, if not born along. When Iſrael went out of Egypt, not a dog barked, but when a ſoul goes out of the bondage of ſinne, into the libertie of Chriſt, many dogs and devils bark and bite: Chriſt therefore as he doth pull out, ſo he doth carry in, whom he faſtens hold on he lets not go, whom he takes into his arms he keeps there, and ſtill carries them there in all conflicts, to make ſure work; all Chriſts children fight in his arms, if the devil can kill them there ſo, they all fight upon this advantage every battell; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113418:15"/>
to heaven is ſecured, the great whale that is maſter of the deep bellies us, and ſaves us from all ſtorms, carries us, and conveyes us to our haven, the kingdome of his dear ſonne.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Chriſt ſaves ſweetly, 'tis pleaſant travelling in his arms, a man may go a great way with eaſe upon anothers legges; the way though long and dirty goes away one knows not how, when bravely carried<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Chriſt will have none deſtroyed nor none tired in the way to heaven. Wiſdomes waves are pleaſant, they go all in coaches and chariots to heaven; 'tis the honour of the way, the ſtate of the king in his kingdome below, to be born up and down ſo. <hi>The king brought me into his chambers,</hi> ſaith the Spouſe. Chriſts yoke is eaſie, eaſie indeed, becauſe born upon anothers neck: you yoke creatures ſo that their yoke may not pinch, you uſe art to leſſen labour, and make work no work, and pains pleaſures: Chriſt is excellent at this art, he doth ſo yoke every one, that he draws with eaſe, he makes eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ones yoke big enough to put in his own neck together with the man, and ſo he draws himſelf and the man too, and that is an eaſie yoke indeed, and a little burthen: as you put ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of weight ſometimes into a childs hand, and you carry the child with that in his hand: therefore the child eaſily bears, becauſe he and his burden both, are born by another.</p>
               <p>This is ſubſtance according to ſhadow: this ſweet way of ſalvation was typified, in Noah. Noah was transferred by an ark from an old world to a new, and that ſhadowed out ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the very manner of it, Chriſt transferring the ſoul from a bad ſtate to a good. So Iſrael was brought out of Egypt to Canaan, and the Scripture tells you how, juſt as an Eagle carries her young<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as a father carries his children. <hi>Have I conceived all this people, that thou ſhouldst ſay unto me, Carrie them in thy boſome, as a nurſing father carries the ſucking children,</hi> Numbers 11.12. God was more tender then Moſes, it was tedious to him to bear ſo many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo froward, in his boſome to Canaan; yet ſo did God, and ſo would he have had Moſes done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and becauſe he had not patience enough to do it, he died ere he came there; 'tis dangerous not to be compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate, according to expreſſe command, though ones burden be never ſo great. God took up the burden that Moſes would not,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:113418:16"/>
and he tells you how he carried them, <hi>As an Eagle ſtirreth up her neſt, fluttereth over her young, ſpreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, and bears them upon her wings; So the Lord a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone did bear them, and no ſtrange God with him.</hi> Deuterono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie 32.11, 12. God can bear much alone, and will, for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners good, and his own glory, that is, to anſwer types, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill truth.</p>

                  </label> As Chriſt does bear ſouls to heaven, ſo does the devil bear ſouls to hell: evil ſpirits are very painfull too. Who bears your ſouls? Sathan carries by deluſion, ſome are carried about by <hi>winds of Doctrine,</hi> the devil is in that wind; when errour rules the life, Sathan rules the heart, this ſoul is born in the arms of an evil ſpirit. 'Tis a light ſoul that a ly will carry, but his fall will be heavy. Whom Chriſt carries, truth carries; the word of God, and the Spirit of God, are the two wings upon which Chriſt carries ſouls to heaven. Upon what wings do ye flee? By theſe you may know who carries you, whether Chriſt or the devil. Chriſt wraps up ſpirits in the word, and ſo away with them to heaven.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Sathan carries by violence. The Apoſtle Peter tells us of ſome that are carried about by a <hi>tempeſt,</hi> Sathan certainly is in that tempeſt: ſouls born by that evil ſpirit, are hurried. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts are beſide rule, and beſide reſiſtance; ſo are ſouls carried by Sathan; the heart hath choſen its own way, and reaſon muſt not ſtirre, nor divinity leſſe; every thing is irkſome that oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, nothing that contradicts can the man heare; this ſoul is in the devils chariot, tumbling to miſery apace, if God ſtop not no man can. The Lord ſeldom ſtops ſouls when they run apace, till they have fallen and hurt themſelves much, if not ruin'd themſelves quite. Chriſt drives gently, he goes truths way, and truths pace: ſouls carried by Chriſt, go no faſter then truth, ſuch make a ſtop at every turning, and look out, they go ſlowly and ſurely. Chriſt kicks at wilfull ſpirits, but he doth not carry them; they are meek ſouls willing to be carried onely by Chriſt, whom Chriſt carries.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The devil bears to deſtruction, to ruine grace and the ſoul: he bears as he did bear Chriſt, to ruine all, body and ſoul. Souls carried by Sathan, are carried away from God to the glory of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113418:16"/>
the world, to a god which is not God. Carrying away from God is a graduall thing, ſome are carried away more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſome are carried away quite, which I will ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a little. I ſee ſome carried away extremely, which makes my heart tremble to behold. Men are carried away captive, that is, when evil is committed againſt all means uſed to avoid it, and that caſe is afflicting, but not deſtroying: for 'tis the caſe of the beſt ſometimes. The compaſſe is ſet to ſuch a haven, and all mariners working that way, and by force of wind beaten aſide.</p>
               <p>As the heart ſtands to Chriſt, and truth, or not; ſo is the man more or leſſe carried away: ſome plead againſt their own hearts, as working ſo, and ſo unruly, and ſide with conſcience and Chriſtians as condemning them, and wiſh that as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne that which is naught, that ſo they would execute it too, and bury it quite, that like the body of Moſes, neither man nor devil might find it, to make a reſurrection of it again. Others plead for an evil engaged affection, againſt Chriſtians, yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt conſcience; and all the art lies to keep along between theſe two ſmoothly and well, that ſinne and the man may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy themſelves without being notorious both, and afraid one of another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or both of hell; this ſoul is carried very farre from God, if he ſee it, but if not, the man is in a deſperate condition, and yet Chriſt can bear out of this.</p>
               <p>Does God bear ſouls heaven-wards? load him, let him not want imployment, caſt your burdens upon him. Caſting our burdens upon God, turning off perplexing thoughts; making known requeſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and reſting upon God for anſwers. One com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of this, and another of that, but do you complain of all to Chriſt, that he would give you with his everlaſting arms a lift? Iniquity is too heavie for the ſoul, and the ſoul is too hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy for it ſelf, when it onely bears it ſelf, and makes not to Chriſt to be born. Every thing cracks under the weight of ſin: our very ſouls crack under the weight of ſinne. Sinners thank your ſelves: Why is not Chriſt of more uſe with you? You would bear all alone, that will kill you: Chriſt can carry all alone, your ſouls and the guilt and filth that is in them, but none elſe; he did tread the winepreſſe alone. There is art in unload<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſoul upon Chriſt, and it lies in this; in obſerving parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:113418:17"/>
what loads the ſoul, and what Chriſt hath ſaid particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to ſuch a caſe; no ſoul miſcarries of being born to heaven that thus does.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians bleſſe-God, he takes much pains with you: receive this, and I conclude this point. Gods arms are as free for you, as yours for your children. I have often wondred at that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, <hi>They ſhall runne and not be weary:</hi> but now I ſee how it comes about, we run upon anothers legs. Chriſtians, that you keep on the way of God ſo chearfully and ſo reſolutely, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all oppoſition, 'tis Gods bearing of you; bleſſe him, you would wax weary and with-draw, to the perdition of your ſouls elſe. Perſeverance in grace is a great deal of pains to Chriſt, though it be little to us. When you carry children long in your arms, over this ſtile and over that, do not your arms ake? Then think of Chriſt, what bearing your ſouls and your ſinnes is, and whether it be worth thanks. Let him have the burden for the bearing, and if it were all gold: You pay port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for carrying this and that, pay Chriſt well, let him have your ſouls for the carriage of them.</p>

All move as if there did none ſit and judge, but 'tis the misjudgment of the world; for there is a throne ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted here below, and not an action done, not a word, nor a thought, but he that ſits on the throne judges, <hi>he hath one that judges him.</hi> Chriſts throne is inviſible, but not a fancie; and to many inſenſible, but 'twill be the more terrible. What is done in the fleſh is judged there, and what is done in the ſpirit is judged there; within and without you have one that judgeth you: ſenſes cannot reach this, and pride will not; but yet this pulleth not down Chriſts throne, the work goeth on, the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature of a kingdome; theſe Coloſſians found it, they were ſelf-condemned by truth, and carried out of themſelves to Chriſt: <hi>Who hath brought us into the kingdome of his dear ſonne.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Kingdomes have throns of Judicature, and thrones of State: the Lambe hath a ſeat of glory in this world. <hi>Do not abhorre us for thy name ſake, do not diſgrace the throne of thy glory: Remember thou break not covenant with us,</hi> Jeremy 14.21. Diſpenſation of Juſtice and Truth is Chriſts throne of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and ſo diſpenſation of Mercy and Truth is his <hi>throne</hi> of <hi>glory;</hi> by this he ſits and abides very glorious, in the midſt of the Chriſtian world, as by the other he ſits very terrible in the midſt of the wicked.</p>
               <p>Mercy is the moſt glorious thing that miſerable man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds: the leaſt mercy gives Chriſt a ſeat of glory in the world; every flower in the field, every ſtarre in the heavens, every grace in your hearts, ſpeaks out Chriſts glorious ſeat here; name a mercy in the world, and there ſits Chriſt in glory: under this notion is that expreſſion, <hi>Heaven and Earth are full of thy

I may make an externall demonſtration of this: ſuch parts of the creation as in which God moſt manifeſts himſelf for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of all, that is by way of eminence called his throne. <hi>His throne is in the Heavens,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, which is not ſpoken excluſively, as if God had his ſeat no where elſe, but compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, that is, no where ſo eminently as in that part of the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that orders all the reſt. As the moſt noble part of the great world is Gods prime ſeat, ſo the moſt noble part of the little world is his prime throne; his throne is in the heart, in that <hi>totum gubernans.</hi> Thrones are erected in chief places; more of Gods ſtate and glory is to be ſeen in one ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then in all the creation: a ſpirit ſpeaks what God is, and makes at the very <hi>eſſe</hi> of God as it were, whereas all other things ſpeak but what God doth, and ſo make but at his back parts. Where you can find God moſt according to what he is in himſelf, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what ſimilitude he makes to himſelf by operation, there is his ſeat of glory: he ſeated himſelf in the hearts of theſe Coloſſians, and ſhewed himſelf as a God making covenant, which is more then <hi>remembring covenant,</hi> as the Prophet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeaks, and therefore by ſo much the more fitly may be called, the throne of his glory.</p>

As there are thunderings without, ſo there be thunderings within; in great majeſty doth Chriſt ſpeak to the ſoul ſometimes, ask your conſciences elſe: ask Felix, the Goaler, and Cain elſe, yea ask your father Adam

Twenty years time not enough to heal the wound of a word of Gods mouth, O the majeſty of that word!

Chriſt moves, as by a majeſticall, ſo by a ſuperiour power to all, and this is <hi>baſis majestatis. Chriſt is a great King over all,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt titles him; he moves here below by a power above men, above the greateſt of men, above Kings, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; he moves by a power above Angels good and bad; his throne is above thrones, dominions, principalities, that is, thoſe ſpirituall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities which by Angels are expended; he rules, yea he cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivates all, which is more. <hi>Every knee bow to him of things

in Heaven, of things in earth, and of things under earth,</hi> men and Angels, good and bad. The Sunne is ſupream and ſwayes all virtues of the Heavens and earth: Chriſts dominion is from the ſea to the worlds end, there is not a power from one end of the world to the other, but 'tis under Chriſt. The firſt Adam was over all and ſo is the ſecond, his motion yet but darkly ſpeaks this, but 'twill every day now more then other; the kingdomes of the world will become the kingdomes of Chriſt; what he yet darkly over rules, he will take viſibly into his hands, and the kingdomes ſhall become one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and under one: Iſrael had one <hi>Lord; the Lord thy God is one [Lord.</hi> Diſtance of place deſtroyes not the Supremacy of Chriſts Kingdome, nor the Monarchicall government of it, which will be plain by this demonſtration. Talk with Chriſtians here and talk with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in the furtheſt part of the world, and you ſhall find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of divine motion within and without amongſt them all, which ſpeaks them all under one ſupremacy, all ſubjects of one kingdome, though ſo farre diſtant: they grone under ſinne as you do, and extoll Chriſt as you do; face anſwereth to face, and yet theſe faces never ſaw one another: pulſe beat, and ſpirits work alike, the ſtate is the ſame, the bloud is the ſame, though it run in various veins, and ſome to the extreme parts of the earthen fabrick. As things are in their native power Chriſt is above them, and ſupream; and as things aſpire and exalt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and pretend to ſomething above their native ſtate; as things ſtrut themſelves, and ſtand a tiptoe, ſo Chriſt alſo is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them.

that render one to another, as Joſeph to his brethren, <hi>nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers: I will nouriſh you,</hi> ſaith he to his brethren, <hi>fear not,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt hath a ſcepter, he rules not by tyranny but by law, which law of his kingdome you have written, as the Jews had the laws of their kingdome; and not an action of God about the creature, but is in reference to the written law; all motion of Chriſt is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to truth. Chriſt doth not his own private will, but a joynt will conſented to by each perſon, and publiſhed, which is the meaning of that expreſſion, <hi>I came not to do mine own will, but the will of my Father.</hi> He came to fulfill one volume, another volume is written, and he will come and fulfill that too, and then 'twill be well with us. Chriſt moves ſo exactly by the word, that this and not he ſhall judge men at the laſt day. Rule makes actions juſtice or not juſtice; where there is no law, there is no tranſgreſſion. The ſhining juſtice of all Chriſts actions, ſhall ſilence every guilty ſoul at the laſt day. Chriſts courſe was nothing elſe, but a fulfilling what was written; his ſayings ſeemed hard, and yet he ſpake but the written word: Juſtice is in the worſt word or work you wrangle at: his ſcepter is a right ſcepter, a ſcepter of righteouſneſſe; his carriage is but the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word organiz'd, and made to ſpeak to you ſtill as you are; the word made fleſh, and wrapt up in a mouth of fleſh like your own, and made to talk to you, and to tell you your own, which is the ſcepter of Chriſts kingdome. The ſumme of all is this, <hi>Chriſt doth manage a publick ſtate here, a kingdome,</hi> that is, he puts forth a power to the ſubduing and ordering of many, to their felicity and his own glory, and to the deſtruction of all that oppoſe theſe two.</p>

                  </label> A kingdome ſpeaks ſubjection of multitudes, the ordering of many to the felicitie of all, and to the glory of one, as head of all. What power Chriſt manages in the world, that look after in your ſelves: Untaimed creatures! what do you think of your ſelves? truth is of little power to ſubdue ſinne, and order the heart, and yet men think they are brought into the kingdome of Chriſt.

time of warre, how many battells have Sathan and your ſouls fought? you glory to be quiet men, and Sathan likes it well, he is as unwilling to be troubled as you. Many ſinners ſcarce ever gave their ſinfull hearts a check, and yet cannot but judge well of their condition, they ſo ſinfully dote upon themſelves, nor can they judge well of any elſe, that think not of them as they do.</p>
               <p>Sathan and I have fought many a time ſaith one, we have had many a hot bout together; and who is overcome? Sathan or thy ſoul? Sathan is expert at his weapons, able well to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf, he is not conquered preſently; he hath ſtrong holds, and a ſtrong art to hold them, Know ye his wiles, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant ſouls? you think you fight with the devil, when you ſet Sathan to caſt out Sathan, one luſt to croſſe another. Some men can diſtinguiſh between humour and reaſon, and can ſet reaſon to fight againſt humour, and both to fight againſt Chriſt. Doth truth carry you againſt humour and reaſon both, againſt all that oppoſeth? This ſpeaks the dominion of Chriſt. <hi>I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted not with fleſh and bloud,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; he doth not ſay I conſulted not with Sathan and ſinne: fleſh and bloud ſpeaks reaſon, and yet when this oppoſeth Chriſt, a ſoul under his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion waves it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Diſcretion</note>Some are not farre from the kingdome of God, as Chriſt ſpeaks, and yet never come there. 'Tis an obſervable expreſſion, that of Chriſt to the ſcribe, <hi>When Jeſus ſaw that he anſwered diſcreetly,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>he ſaid unto him, thou art not farre from the kingdome of God,</hi> Mark 12.34. Reaſon ſeaſonably and forcibly acted is diſcretion: diſcretion is a courſe divinity, and it conſiſts in ſquaring action to externall applauſe; and men that can reach this height uſually ſtick there, which is dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo I fear did that ſcribe; 'twas enough that he had ſo ſpoken, as to winne applauſe, for I heare no more of him in that ſtory. Londoners, moſt of you have knowledge enough, and many of you can manage it to great applauſe; you are not farre from the kingdome of God, and yet reſt here, and you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come there. I love diſcretion dearly, and yet I have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved many diſcreet men, the moſt bitter enemies to the power of godlineſſe; they can honour nothing above their own ſphere:
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:113418:20"/>
holy zeal is wild-fire with them; their own pace after Chriſt faſt enough, and this oft times looſeth Chriſt, ſoul and all. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion is good at meaſuring virtue, but bad at meaſuring grace, 'twill give much to Chriſt but not all, it lacks ſtill one thing, as Chriſt ſaid to the young man, and commonly that one thing is ſomething which carries the heart with it, which is all: the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Chriſt is not in that ſoul. Men merely diſcreet, are not yet brought into the kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Some go beyond diſcretion, and make flanting profeſſion,<note place="margin">Profeſſion.</note> and yet prove not well. There be children of the kingdome, and yet not in the kingdome, <hi>children of the kingdome ſhut out,</hi> children of one kingdome ſhut out from another. Chriſts kingdome hath ſome externalitie, many called and no more, few choſen: ſuch as ſtand within the externall call of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and make as if they did heare; boaſt of the Temple and the name of the Lord, and depart not from iniquitie, theſe are children of the kingdome, and yet children of that wicked one. Londoners, look to your ſelves, you are children of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Chriſt calls to you, all is glorious, and you all ſeem glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to hearken to it, but I obſerve ſome of your wayes, and there I ſee you wipe off all your paint, and your life ſpeaks your ſouls dead, and many friends about you mourn for the dead. I ſee their tears in bibles, every Lords day. Sir pray for my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, pray for my maſter, they talk and make a ſhew but have nothing in them, they have a name that they live, but are dead; O Sir, pray that they may not be twiſe dead and plucked up by the roots. Perſons about you, they ſee the unſoundneſſe of your profeſſion, and you ſee nothing. Hypocriſie is a ſecret but a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mortall evil, it lives and thrives under all contrary forms. Children of the kingdome, look about you, and I have done.</p>
               <p>If you receive not the kingdome of God, as a little child, you cannot enter into it. Little infants, parents may carry them where they will: Truth muſt carry you whither it will, if you fight againſt it you cannot kill it, but you will kill your ſouls. Rebellious ſtrugglings are ſoul-ſtabbings; carry things by force againſt all divine reſiſtance, and you run head-long to Hell. Out of ſelf is the way into the kingdome of Chriſt: pleaſure muſt be nothing, parts nothing; nothingneſſe is the way to all.

                  <hi>Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit, for theirs is the kingdome</hi> we ſpeak of. Lay your ſpirits naked before Chriſt, and let him further ſtrip them as he will, and then cloath them, and order them as he will, and this is the way to a kingdome: it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing painfull to get into Chriſts kingdome, but when you are once into it, you would not be out of it again for all the world.</p>

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Love is the common doore by which all favours go forth to all children: ſome children are higher then others in dignity, but none by their wits, or any thing elſe, but all from love. Wits make their way too much with men, and 'tis all the friends which ſome have to riſe by, but they procure no preferment with God; if not beloved, let a man be as crafty as the devil, he will never be rais'd by God. God flatters none; whom he cannot love he tells them ſo in all he doth; every thing works to throw them down, not to raiſe them up, as every thing tends to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of them that are beloved. We do make diſtinction of talents, ſome bigger ſome leſſer; but love hands them out all to children; God gives to all his children with his own hand, adopted ſonnes, and the naturall ſonne have a kingdome; as dear children, as ſonnes of love.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God gives orderly; his heart firſt, and then his hand: perſons are indeared, and then have all, countrey, city, the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Iſaac could not bleſſe at a diſtance, <hi>Come near my ſonne, &amp;c.</hi> God doth not caſt great bleſſings he knows not upon whom, he takes perſons very near him, relates them, and indears them, and then advanceth them. <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love

There are kings in wrath in a temporall ſenſe, but none ſo in a ſpirituall: all ſpirituall kings are kings in love, and from love ſet up, and kept up. Kings of a little ſpot of earth, and the king of all the earth, all one in the originall of their preferment, all children of love, therefore children of honour and greatneſſe, and carry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all from all the world beſide. The heart of God is the foot-ſtool up to the throne for all.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God gives purely: nothing without him ingages him to any, no not to the naturall ſonne, You are given unto, and therefore give, but God gives ſo to none: <hi>Who hath given unto him firſt?</hi> did the naturall ſonne? or do the adopted ſonnes? All his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have what they have, becauſe beloved; love onely is the wombe that brought forth ſonnes, and a kingdome for them. Deſigne makes you ſtir, but God cannot be more happy then he is, the advancing of love is all his deſigne in all he raiſes; he makes perſons great to make great his love, no ſonne ſhould have had a kingdome, neither adopted ſonne nor naturall ſonne, had it not been to make great his love. Love is the efficient and finall cauſe of all Gods actions towards all his children; the naturall ſonne and the adopted ſonne are made great of love and for love; ſet up by love, that love may be ſet up by them, and for no other deſigne.</p>
               <p>Gods gives ſolacingly: that is, ſo as to delight himſelf in what he gives, ſo as to delight the giver as well as thoſe that are given to: all given in love makes a heaven to God and to man, to the giver, and to the receiver. The motion of father and children each to other, is by the ſame ſpirit: children move towards their father in love; and that's the heaven of their way; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement and kingdome which they give God in their hearts is in love. Father moves to all his children in love, and that's the heaven of his way: the fruit of the ſpirit is love, ſo the reward
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:113418:22"/>
of the ſpirit is love; the one ſpeaketh that which we give to God, and that is love; and the other ſpeaketh that which God gives to us, and that is love: Gods way within and without to all his, is in a rapture, he makes a heaven to himſelf in making one for us. All motions between father and children make love-meetings; we obey him in love, and he crowns us in love; adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſonnes and the naturall ſonne, all Gods children move in love to their father, and their father meets them in love, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth them; ſo did Chriſt advance his father, and ſo did his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advance him as a dear ſonne.</p>

                  </label> You ſee Gods generall way of raiſing perſons, he firſt loves and then advances, not a perſon in the world doth God preferre out of this method. Many men have a mind too much to a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven here and hereafter, but no mind to look after the love of God; wrath ſecretly conſumes theſe, in their blind ſtrugglings to be happy. Is hatred or love faſtened upon you? ſo will you riſe or fall, ſtruggle and ſtrive, and do what you can. Is deſpiſed Chriſt a ſonne of God, a ſonne of love? If he be of that ſeed he will riſe, and will flouriſh into a kingdome, notwithſtanding all the devils in hell oppoſe. Is Mordecai of the beloved ſeed? then he will riſe, let Haman ſtruggle his heart out. Is Haman an Agagite, of the curſed Amalekites? then he will fall, and all the favour in the world cannot keep him up.</p>
               <p>I am grieved to ſee what prepoſterous wayes men take for preferment, the love of this man, and that man is made out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and not the love of God, as the onely medium to riſe by. I view the wayes of men, and ſigh in ſecret; I ſee one man make a god of another to get up, and he that is indeed God, and the onely giver of honour and worth neglected. Men move accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their principles, ſenſe undoes all; greatneſſe is neither from Eaſt nor Weſt, advancement is by a very inviſible hand, and you onely catch hold of hands which you ſee, to lift you up to a kingdome, to ſuch a great felicitie which you aim at. How low do moſt men move to be high! The ſoul is enſlaved which makes humane induſtry, all his endeavour to be bleſſed. The countenance of God ſets up, or throws down man: if all the world did love you, could they make you bleſſed? could they raiſe your eternall eſtate? Deluded ſycophants! men may give
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:113418:22"/>
you fields and vineyards; but can they give you a kingdome, an everlaſting kingdome? and yet ſo doth God to his favourites, to adopted ſonnes, and to the naturall ſonne.</p>
               <p>Know your errour, 'tis ruining, you that look onely after the love of men to riſe, which make ſo much of the love of man, and ſo little of the love of God. Both may be purſued, but ſubordinately and candidly, otherwiſe a man makes fleſh his arm, and himſelf liable to the curſe of ſuch a condition. A great many men love me, but what will this do me good when I die, if this be all the favour I have? Can mens ſhoulders carry me to the kingdome of heaven? Will the vapours of many mens mouthes make ſilver wings to carry my ſoul to heaven? What will conſcience cry out for, think you, when that pale meſſenger comes to call you hence? Ah my ſoul! thou art now to leave every body indeed, thy very own body in which thou haſt lived ſo long: Doth God love thee? conſcience will ask this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on again and again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O ſoul, ſoul. thou art to be gone out of the body preſently, doth God love thee? dear ſoul, art thou dear to God? One ſpirit is going to another, two ſpirits muſt reaſon together about all things done in the fleſh, and ſtanders by may not plead a jot, onely what is in the breaſt of God to plead for thee, or againſt thee. Sinners, what is in the breaſt of a God towards you? love or hatred? So will be your great happineſſe, or your great miſery, in this world and that to come.</p>
               <p>Love ſpeaks it ſelf, and ſo hatred ſpeaks it ſelf: by Gods deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with you, you may know whether he loves or hates you. God is dear to them which are dear to him, relations are indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on both ſides: God loves all his children dearly, and they love him dearly. Chriſt was dear to his father, and his father dear to him; he would rather die then diſobey his will. The ſpirit of the naturall ſonne, is in all the adopted: if God be your father, where is his honour? Death is eaſier then diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to a child of God. Relations have their proper nature, they that are begotten love him that begat; God hath no unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall child. Some of you ſtand upon your ſonne-ſhip, and yet tranſgreſſe the will of your father with eaſe: is he indeed your father which you call ſo, and uſe ſo? Are relations, the higheſt relations without bowels? can you uſe your father at your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure?
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113418:23"/>
Do you love God, and fight againſt him, againſt his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within, and againſt his truth and people without? Our war in England certainly diſcovers a great many dear children of the devil, as well as a great many dear children of God. 'Tis a time of great thoughts of heart, a time of great-ſtirring, and 'tis a brave time to know your hearts, and who is in them; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God or the devil; when humours ſtirre much, 'tis the onely time to know the ſtate of the man, and what is his diſtemper. God lives in every heart he loves, and ſtirres as he lives: how divine are the ſtrings of your hearts now? how generally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine? how ſtrongly divine? There are not two better things to demonſtrate any ones eſtate; not any love ſpeaks the love of a father. Chriſt looked upon the young man, and loved him; but 'twas not with any indearing love: ſo not any love ſpeaks the love of a child, but that love which takes up the heart, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dears God there: <hi>How precious are thy commandments; my ſoul loves them,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt: and ſo elſewhere, <hi>My ſoul thirſteth after thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Pſal. 143.3. Weak ſouls ſhould warm and comfort themſelves in that flame they feel in their ſouls towards Chriſt and his wayes.</p>
               <p>I am to be generall in conſolation to all Gods people, from this point: think how you are to God, very dear, and refreſh your ſouls with it in all ſad conditions. Miſery ſinks us becauſe we think every humane diſtreſſe ſpeaks divine diſpleaſure, or at leaſt an abatement of love. Afflicted Chriſtians! adde not to your load, God is never out with them he loves; all miſery ſpeaks not divine diſpleaſure. Miſery ſpeaks divine diſpleaſure onely, when it makes the ſoul wicked, more adherent to ſinne, and leſſe to Chriſt and Chriſtians. Some mens bitters from God, make them bitter and ſowre to good; I like not that ſtate: God would make a baſtard a ſonne, and he will not be correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Miſeries which make you groan under ſinne, and groan af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, ſpeak you very dear children to God, how heavie ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be, and you ſhould account ſuch bitters ſweets. Let ſuch mourners chear themſelves, God is very mindfull of your condition.</p>
               <p>As things are dear to us, ſo we think of them: <hi>Is Ephraim my dear ſonne? is he a pleaſant child? Since I ſpake againſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:113418:23"/>
him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill.</hi> Thy folly may be ſpoken againſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet thy perſon very dear, and thy diſtreſſes compaſſionately carried in mind, when thou thinkeſt all are ſlighted. Chriſt ſtrikes with one hand, and ſtrokes with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 'tis his uſuall carriage to children. Speak againſt them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, and ſpeaks for them at the ſame time before God his Father: <hi>Since I ſpake against him, I remember him ſtill, I do earneſtly remember him as yet; recordando recordabor ejus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huc,</hi> as they read the text, which is very lively. When miſery is upon a child of God, he thinks then he is forgotten, and then he is moſt remembred, then 'tis not <hi>recordabor ejus, I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him,</hi> but 'tis <hi>recordando recordabor, I will certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member him,</hi> or <hi>I will earneſtly remember him;</hi> now in that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time that I have ſpoken againſt Ephraim a dear ſonne, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that I have laid upon him, I do as yet earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mind him: as divine love is towards us, ſo it works; if it be ſtrong towards a perſon, it is very earneſtly intent about him for good. Dear hearts in affliction! believe that God remembers you, and that he remembers you earneſtly, your deliverance is ſhaping day and night, and thoughts ſhall never lie ſtill till it be finiſhed, and you confeſſe what a deal of love is ſet upon you.</p>
               <p>Dear children, your bleſſedneſſe is above all mens here, let times and fortunes favour perſons as they will, troubles may be great, but yet your mercy will be certain; many may ſink under them, but ſurely you will not, if the mercy of a God be enough to keep your head above water. Others have nothing ſure, you have all ſure, the mercy of God ſure, in which is all. If Ephraim be a dear ſonne, then my bowels are troubled for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>I will ſurely have mercy upon him,</hi> ſaith the Lord. Dear children of God, rejoyce in theſe ſad times, your bleſſedneſſe hath as ſure a foundation as truth it ſelf, if God can inſure any thing, you will never miſcarry. Your bleſſedneſſe will be certain, let times and ſtates turn and overturn as they will; yea, your mercies will be great. What God is in heart to any, he is in hand; where he loves much, he gives and forgives much. Dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, I cannot tell exactly how great you will be, you will all have a kingdome, let this kingdome ſtand or fall; the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:113418:24"/>
naturall ſonne and the adopted ſonnes have all kingdomes, and the one doth not envie the other, but joyes in it; the naturall ſonne is ſtill moving and mediating that this wretched world may have as full a demonſtration of this as can be; that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſonne, and the adopted ſonnes may be loved with the ſame love, and honoured with the ſame honour, is one paſſage of Chriſts prayer, and dear children read it often. <hi>I in them and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Redemption notes four things, a perſon in bondage, a priſe paid a releaſe, and a free ſtate; all which it may be I may little open to you. Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notes bondage a deſtreſſed ſtate, and ſuch a diſtreſſed ſtate, to wit, one thing under the burthenſome and deſtructive power of another; ſo was Iſrael under Pharaoh. Egypt was a houſe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:113418:24"/>
of bondage, many together under a burdenſome deſtructive power; and it was to preach their ſpirituall condition; and their ſtubbornneſſe occaſioned that ſtrong way of inſtruction. God made a feſcue of the body, to point to the ſoul: fallen man is a ſoul ſlave, under the burdenſome deſtructive power of ſinne, and wrath; luſt carries him captive to ſinne, ſinne carries him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to wrath, and wrath carries him captive to hell, which is the great houſe of bondage for eternitie; where many are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under a tormenting deſtructive power as long as God is. Priſons have various rooms; but ſome more ſad then others, much lower and darker then others; hell is the dungeon of the houſe of bondage which fallen man is in; all the rooms are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame roof, under the ſame power and wrath, and doores out of one into another, and but a wall between room and room, but a wall between a man in ſinne, and a man in hell: this is a ſad condition, yet univerſall, not a child of Adam free born. Jews and Gentiles, all are under ſinne, ſo many men, and ſo men ſlaves, <hi>[I am carnall] and ſold under ſinne,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. As a ſlave is ſold from one bondage to another, ſo one ſinne ſells my ſoul to another, and all ſinne ſells me to the diſpleaſure of God: me thinks this is the Apoſtles fancie of the thing I am upon. Not a man but in miſerie, and not a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie but in ſinne; ſinne is the great houſe of bondage here, in which we are all, in which you are, and I am. <hi>I am carnall and ſold under ſinne,</hi> and ſo are you, and this is the caſe of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, which is intimated in the text. In whom we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; the Apoſtle puts in himſelf and thoſe to whom he wrote.</p>
               <p>Fallen man is under the power of ſinne, and under the power of wrath; ſinne can do what it will with the ſoul, and ſo can juſtice with ſoul and bodie, and yet be juſt. Sinne is Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and hath made God mans enemie, man is under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the greateſt adverſarie in the world; a puniſhing power is fallen mans keeper, and it follows him whitherſoever he goes: ſome dead have a waking ghoſt, to tell under whoſe cuſtody they are; as after a man is brought home to God and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, mercy follows the man to the end of his dayes whereever he goes, and the man under the cuſtody of love, and of a friend
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:113418:25"/>
for ever: ſo before brought home to God, man is a priſoner to wrath, and under the cuſtody of a ruining power, and this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows him up and down the world to the end of his dayes, <hi>They ſhall follow cloſe after thee,</hi>

                     <hi>Jer. 42.16.</hi> Or cleave after you.</note> ſaith God, ſpeaking of ſword and famine. Wrath is ordered to follow cloſe after ſinners, as its priſoners, leſt they ſhould eſcape away before ſatisfaction be made. This as the other I ſpake of ere while, is a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; as all are under the power of ſinne, ſo are all under the power of wrath, and not a man but a captive to divine diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure naturally; ceaſed upon by juſtice, and under cuſtody for hell, if no redemption come. The houſe of bondage hath three rooms, ſinne, wrath, and deſtruction, and they all lie one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in another. There is a bondage of ſinne, and a bondage of wrath, and a bondage of corruption, as the Apoſtle calls the languiſhing ſtate of the whole creation, and all theſe mutually depending, and a common condition; the earth periſhing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature upon the earth periſhing, man the nobleſt creature, under the bondage of ſinne, wrath, and deſtruction, and all hinted here in theſe words, <hi>we have redemption,</hi> that is, from ſinne, wrath, and the fruits of it.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Redemption notes ſatisfaction, power holding and looſing it ſelf, as having found a ranſome. Redemption is no free thing ſimply, though ſo in order to us; what is free to us, is not to Chriſt, ſatisfaction is made to juſtice, and ſo the priſoner ſet free, <hi>We are bought with a priſe.</hi> Power commanding, propoſeth its will, will propoſeth its juſtice, juſtice propoſeth its violation to the delinquent, and demands it recompence according to this: violation of truth, of the leaſt truth, is the death of Gods will, and ſo the death of himſelf; the death of one thing, in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice calls for the death of another, and without delay will have it. <hi>In the day thou eateſt thou ſhalt die.</hi> The death of God, is more then the death of all the men in the world, and therefore juſtice demands more for ſatisfaction, then mere man-dying, for if man-dying would make God ſatisfaction, then when all men are dead, juſtice would be ſatisfied, and ſo the drowning of the whole world, would have been its ranſome, and the burning of this world its redemption; whereas it is but the breaking forth of juſtice unſatisfied, and laying up the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:113418:25"/>
debters which are many in a ſure priſon: the death of God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable with us, and calls in juſtice for more then the death of mere man, and therefore God-man dies to redeem. <hi>And [for this cauſe he is the mediatour] of the new teſtament; that by means of death, for the redemptions of the tranſgreſſions, that were under the firſt teſtament,</hi> &amp;c. Hebr. 6.15. Legall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptions had this law, to propoſe worth, to worth, and ſo to make ſatisfaction as exact as might be (E. G.) an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, and bloud for bloud, and the moſt precious bloud for the moſt precious bloud, the bloud of a man for the bloud of a man, and without bloud, yea without <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine tali</hi> ſuch bloud, their was no redemption, no redemption in a humane ſence, becauſe no ſatisfaction, and that pointed to this in my text, which is exactly noted, <hi>redemption through his bloud.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Redemption notes diſcharge, actuall and full diſcharge. Death paid, bonds are cancelled, nothing in will, and if their were, yet nothing in power to proſecute further; juſtice ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nothing is charged, nothing in the will nor power of any; no not in the will nor power of God to charge man. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to their charge?</hi> If ye ſay God, he juſtifies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſatisfied, and can do no otherwiſe, 'tis the Apoſtles ſtrength of reaſoning. Redemption takes off obligation to juſtice, though not obligation to mercy. <hi>We are not under the law, but under grace.</hi> The law can charge no guilt upon a believer, becauſe grace hath ſatisfied: the law can charge no guilt, but grace can charge duty, that is, what ſoever the royall law, and what ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the whole will of God requires, that grace which hath died obliges to. <hi>We are under grace,</hi> that is, under all the commands of it, to fulfill all that righteouſneſſe, as farre forth as we can, which grace hath fulfilled exactly; we are under grace imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and under the law mediately, as love to Chriſt ſets the ſoul to the fulfilling of the whole will of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>quantum in ſe eſt.</hi> Redemption notes releaſe from guilt, and from rigour; ſinne doth not dame, nor duty doth not diſcourage, precepts bind graciouſly, to the utmoſt of what imperfect man is able, and not to the utmoſt of what a perfect rule may require. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption is from a yoke of bondage, and not from all yokes:
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:113418:26"/>
from a yoke of bondage to an eaſie yoke, and a light burthen; from legall bondage, to Goſpel bondage, which is perfect li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie: which is a law as James calls it, but yet a perfect law of liberty. Redemption is from all ſinne, but from no ſervice, which the Goſpel calls for.</p>
               <p>Goſpel releaſe is likewiſe double, in heaven or in earth, <hi>their is a looſing in heaven, and a looſing in earth,</hi> a diſcharge in the perſon of Chriſt, and a diſcharge in our own perſon, a generall diſcharge in a generall perſon, and a particular diſcharge made out by that generall perſon, to every particular. There is peace in Jeſus Chriſt, and preaching of peace by Jeſus Chriſt, deliverance made for captives, and deliverance preached to captives, a miniſteriall diſcharge. Divine diſcharge hath a double adminiſtration, one above, and another below: heaven is made to ſpeak and explain her ſelf out of earth, and to tell to whom it belongs, and then the redeemed can ſay, that his redeemer lives; and this is Gods <hi>bearing record in earth.</hi> Much love breaking forth in earthen ordinances, and running out of earthen veſſells, to the ſenſible apprehenſion of the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; a voice from heaven in earth; in a frail corrupt ſtate, a diſtinct artificiall voice, <hi>Thou art all fair;</hi> and yet underſtood by none but the party to whom 'tis ſpoken; a white ſtone with a name fairly ingraven in it, and yet none can ſee it or reade it, but he that receives it. Our diſcharge in heaven, in what ſtate and glory 'tis, is peculiar to thoſe agents, 'tween whom things firſt paſſe, and without hint, I think to us here. Our diſcharge here, in what ſtate and glory 'tis carried, within in the ſoul, ask not me, but ask your own ſouls, for 'tis honour peculiar and private, to every redeemed ſoul, and carried with more ſtate or leſſe, according to the pleaſure of God. The ſumme of all is this, <hi>Redemption is a ſinner diſcharged by the death of Chriſt from the power of ſinne and wrath.</hi>

If theſe men be free. they are <hi>free among the dead,</hi> and therefore if you have any life, look about you. Soul-powers are dead, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the ſoul ſo free to do what it liſts; without controll. Looſe ſouls, you are no free-men, but dead men, and all friends are dead that ſhould look to you; underſtanding is dead, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction dead, conſcience dead, and therefore are you ſo lively in ſinne, ſo free to do what you liſt. The ſoul dead in ſinne, wrath tolls and rings out; but the dead heare nothing. The dead are buried out of Gods ſight, ere they are aware; hell is the grave of a dead ſoul, which is fartheſt out of Gods ſight of any place; and that is the Golgotha for ſouls, the place of ſpirituall skulls, where the skulls of the inward man lie. Prepare mourning, you that have dead in your houſes and hearts, for the dead will be buried quickly and ſtrangely, hell opens of a ſudden, and takes in her dead, which is a ſtrange grave and buriall.</p>
               <p>Bodily bondage is exactly looked after, but ſoul-bondage not; parts are imployed much without, but little within, and this fault is very common and very crying. I am afraid there is many amongſt you, that do not know what ſpirituall bondage is, and yet it ſpeaks out it ſelf. There is a ſpirit of bondage, and a ſtate of bondage, the one is terrible, the other is damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I will touch them each a little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you may truly know your ſtate and remedy. A ſpirit of bondage is a frequent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the diſpleaſure of God, without juſt ground. Wrath is many mens due, but they which ſhould apply it to themſelves do not, and they which ſhould not, do; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil is in both, to deſtroy all if it were poſſible. Men which love their ſinnes, and are loth to leave them, make application of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but mercy and theſe choak themſelves with ſweet meats, and ſurfet of childrens bread; men which are weary of their ſinnes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would gladly leave them, make application of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing bur juſtice, and this is deadly too, if God did not pitty it,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:113418:27"/>
and cure it. Application of God is mans prerogative alone, to reſtore his happineſſe, but it is rarely uſed rightly to this end; it makes bondage ſtill, and not redemption from it, when not grounded truly upon the word. Falſe application is ſtill from falſe principles, with a diabolicall power concurring. A man not well enlightened thinks his life muſt be perfect, ere his ſoul muſt apply Chriſt; but the one cannot be, and the want of the other keeps the ſoul in bondage, in hell here. Sinne felt and loathed, Chriſt prized and yet unapplyed, is a ſpirit of bondage: fear eats out this poore ſoul, and if there were no dreadfull do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the land, yet this ſoul would ſtill be at his wits end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe like Rachel, a refuſer of his own mercy: This is a houſe of bondage for a time.</p>
               <p>We have told you of a ſpirit of bondage, and now we are to tell you of a ſtate of bondage, and this the Apoſtle very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſets forth, 2, Pet. 2.19, <hi>Whileſt they promiſed them liberty, they themſelves are the ſervants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the ſame is he brought in bondage.</hi> Mans will propoſed as a rule, and all voluntarily and violently ſerving this, is a ſtate of bondage. Corruption is an ill inmate, and a worſe landlord; and yet rules all in the moſt, and ſhall do ſo, &amp; that is a ſtate of bondage. The old man hath his commands, his commands are alwayes congruous to fleſh, not to truth, and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to theſe in love, ſpeaks a ſervant of corruption. Men little eie their hearts, yet from thence muſt be drawn the denomination of your ſtate, and not from this good action, or that, nor not from this bad action or that: <hi>Of what a man is [overcome] of the ſame he is brought in bondage.</hi> That which is ſet up within for a rule of motion, that hath <hi>overcome the man:</hi> they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in falſe light, and ſet up this in their ſouls through love, to to guide their courſe. Ah, ſaith the Apoſtle, you are overcome now, and brought in bondage; but then there's himſelf as well as he could, 'tis but a proverb ſaith he fulfilled, <hi>The dog is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his vomit;</hi> you were never but dogs; what you left for a while, you did not diſlike it, it onely diſliked you, and this made a vomiting like a dog, and therefore are you ſo apt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to it again, and to embrace ſuch doctrines as tend to deſtroy Chriſt and grace. What principles are preferred in the ſoul for
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:113418:27"/>
ordering life, you beſt know, look to theſe; I can but demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to you from truth, that of theſe you are overcome and in bondage, if bad.</p>
               <p>If our diſcourſe diſcover any in a ſtate of bondage, let God be honoured, and the condition taken to heart, the ſoul is loſt elſe. His you are to whom you ſerve, and Sathan will claim his propriety, when you come to die, though he ſay little to you now. Gods ſervants have a jubilee at death, the trumpet ſounds, and the ſoul which long lived in bondage in the body, is made to go out free, to a ſtate of freedome and felicity to all eternity. But ah! what a black jubilee is death to Sathans ſervants? The trumpet ſounds, and bondmen with their chains gingling come forth to the Judge of all the world, and the Goalour ſtands up, Theſe are my priſoners ſaith Sathan; that ſhall be tried ſaith Chriſt; Judgement is given upon triall: now they are more mine, for ever mine, ſaith the devil: and God will not wrong the devil of his own. Now is bondage ſealed, make free who can: What is done at the laſt judgment, is done as the acts of the Medes and Perſians, that is, not to be recalled. Soul-bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage is a <hi>gendring</hi> thing, as the Goſpel uſeth the expreſſion, one degree of bondage genders another, till at laſt you be ſo faſt bound, that there will be no looſing.</p>
               <p>Hagarins, lay to heart your condition betime, and enquire after a Redeeemer; grone under your bondage, and the redeemer will come to you: this is that <hi>turning from tranſgreſſion,</hi> which the prophet ſpeaks of, and to which ſtate a redeemer is promiſed: Eſa. 59.20. <hi>And the redeemer ſhall come to Sion, and to them that turn from tranſgreſsion in Jacob.</hi> There is the proper and peculiar law of the redeemer, which if ye obſerve not, ye cannot be redeemed. As every creature hath its proper action, ſo alſo it hath its proper law, and without the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which, it will not ſo act. It is the proper action of the ſpirit to comfort, and this ſpirit hath its law. you muſt be led by the ſpirit; for if you grieve him, he will not comfort you: So the proper action of the Sonne is to redeem, and he hath his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per law about this work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> without the obſervation of which, he will not foul his fingers with filthy ſouls, and therefore you have him propoſing the law of redemption firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to that man
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:113418:28"/>
which had lien thirty and eight years at the pool; <hi>Wilt thou be made whole?</hi> Whole? why one would think it a ſtrange que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to one that had lien in that extremity ſo long. Wonder not at it, for your caſe is ſhadowed out in it; you have lien long under infirmities, and yet have no will to be made whole, that is, no ardent affection to be redeemed out of them, but content your ſelves to rub-along in them as many lumpiſh perſons do in ſome bodily diſeaſes; you will never get deliverance in this way. Sinners will you be made whole? will you be delivered out of the bondage of ſinne? Do your affections burn, and your hearts beat to be redeemed? That's well: then there is but one ſtep more, believe and you are redeemed out of bondage; and this will be wrought, it will ſpring and grow inſenſibly out of thoſe pantings and breathings which are upon you: <hi>I have ſeen the bondage of my people, and I have heard their cry,</hi> ſaith God. When bondage makes <hi>crying out: O what ſhall I do, and who ſhall deliver me!</hi> Enemies are got into a body, and are deadly ſtrong, a body of death beſets my ſoul, and in the midſt of this body ſhall not I looſe my ſoul? Now the ſinner is <hi>turned from iniquity,</hi> and now <hi>the redeemer comes to Sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let the redeemed admire and adore the redeemer, this one thing I will touch, and give up the point, and I am the rather induced unto it, becauſe 'tis the uſe made in my text: <hi>In whom we have redemption through his bloud.</hi> Which words are ſpoken in way of admiration and thanksgiving, and are but the continuation of that thanksgiving, which is begun in the verſe fore-going. The redemption of the ſoul is precious, ſilver would not reach it, gold would not reach it, onely the precious bloud of Chriſt would do it: precious bloud muſt ſtirre, and precious ſpirits leap from this conſideration as high as heaven, and ſpurtle up in Gods face. Freedome binds man all muſt be ſent to heaven that is ſaved from hell. <hi>Let the redeemed ſay this,</hi> and ſay that, ſaith the Pſalmiſt. Redemption is obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; who ever hangs by his harp, a redeemed perſon muſt not, becauſe he hath his advantage with him above all others, his leſſon ſet and laid before him, yea his inſtrument tuned and put into his hand; <hi>his lips are opened,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, 'tis but ſtirre thy tongue, and matter cannot be wanting, nor affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

be able to lie ſtill. He that died for us muſt be perfumed and carried home honourably, and buried in his own countrey as Jacob was; he that died for you on earth, muſt be perfumed by praiſes, and carried to his own countrey, and buried in heaven. You muſt not bury Chriſt in his works, but take him up out of his works and words, and carry him to heaven, and bury him there. Nature abhorres burying things in their own bloud, you muſt not bury Chriſt in his own bloud, but take him up out of his bloud, and bath him, and perfume him, and lay him to ſleep in the arms of his father.</p>
               <p>The redemption we ſpeak of here, and would have you thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for, reſpects your ſouls, and your bodies; what mercy comes to either, is a bleſſing from Chriſt as a Redeemer. Not a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in theſe bloudy times, but from the bloud of Chriſt, from that great redeemer that ſits in heaven. Bodily redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is but the outſide of ſoul-redemption; I hope the blindeſt ſight will be able to ſee the out-ſides of mercy. Blind wretches! look upon temporall redemptions which now Chriſt makes, and ſee if you can bleſſe him for theſe: you had not had the lives of your bodies, nor the livelihood of your eſtates at this houre, had not your redeemer pleaded for you; had not he pleaded for you w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> his bloud, you had been all ere this, tumbling in your own bloud; you had had your bloud trod under foot by thoſe which have long trod under foot the bloud of Chriſt: One redeemer works all redemptions for ſoul and body: one redeemer pleads in ſoul-caſes, and in bodily caſes. See a full plain place, Prov. 23.18. <hi>Enter not into the fields of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſſe, for their redeemer is mightie, he ſhall plead their cauſe with thee.</hi> It is but one redeemer that pleads for us in ſpirituall things and in corporall, and therefore in all mercies both ſpirituall and corporall, let Chriſt be honoured and praiſed.</p>

by the pleaſure of God, and ſo is mercy; the will of God bounds it, orders it, keeps it in, and lets it forth, through what channells it will; life through death, heaven through hell. The firſt covenant was ſealed with life, the tree of life was the ſeal of Adams firſt grace and favour; the ſecond covenant is ratified with death; the tree of life muſt die, or elſe none could live by eating of it: 'tis not life out of life now, as out of the firſt cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but life out of death, and this neceſſarily, becauſe accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of God <hi>Verily, unleſſe a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alive, but if it die, it bringeth forth fruit,</hi> John 12.24. God hath taken counſell of his will, and turned the ſea of love into a new channell; the firſt covenant gave out all favours without bloud, but the ſecond through bloud, through Chriſts bloud and our own,<note place="margin">Chriſts cup is called Gods will, and our cup is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Chriſts will.</note> the will of God orders both theſe, and therefore is Chriſts cup, when full of bloud, ſaid to be Gods will, <hi>not my will but thine,</hi> &amp;c.

                  </label> Let no man be offended if mercy come any way to ſinners, though through never ſo much bloud and miſery. Sinne had totally and finally cloſed up every wombe of grace, and it could not enter into the imagination of any creature, that ever any dramme of mercy ſhould find any way to them: that the earth opens after much ſweating and labouring, and that heaven o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens after much ſweating and bleeding, to ſend forth favours to ſinners, is beyond the expectation of men and Angels. Mercy lay buried under impoſſibility of reſurrection; impoſſibilities reduced to difficulties, and grace become feſable, though with much coſt, is admirable. Deadly ſentence was with redoubled ſtrength paſſed, and not with a ſyllable of revocation, for any loſt creature to make the leaſt gueſſe at any reſtauration. <hi>By dying thou ſhalt die,</hi> &amp;c. Here is the grave of a whole world of felicity, and a ſtone rolled upon it, daring all powers in heaven and in earth, to open it if they can; and that grace notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſo buried, ſhould riſe and become atainable, is admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. I wonder that all the world is not bleeding and howling in hell, and every one catching his bloud as it falls, and writing out his fall in capitall letters, to the glory of juſtice to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie., 'tis wonderfull to me, that it is not the whole imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the creatures in this world, to drown one another in bloud, to ſtab, tear, and rend one another in pieces without any

ceaſing, as that world below doth; that there are not two hells, a higher and a lower, an upmoſt, and a nethermoſt, and that this is not as bad as that; that all of this ſide heaven, is not hell out-right.</p>
               <p>Murmuring ſpirits be patient, you think much to ſee ſo much ſpoil and bloudſhed in the land, 'tis the way of God to bring great things to man; through the bloud of prime brave perſons, are brave things brought forth. Is there a braver perſon then Chriſt in the land, or in any land? and yet through his ſides and through his bloud, muſt great and gallant favours come. You eye your pain, and not Gods pleaſure, his way is in the deep, the Leviathan tumbles there, in the ſea, in the red ſea, in bloud and death; to life and glory; do ye think to juſtle God out of his wayes as ye juſtle a man? Murmuring, is ſpirit juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againſt ſpirit, a bad againſt a good, and the worſt will have the worſt; for God treads ſuch to death, as will not give him his way. You know that God fell out with his own people deadly; when they diſliked the way of hardſhip, which he had caſt them into to humble them, and to do them good under heathen princes. Let a wiſe man propoſe ſuch an end, and ſuch a way to it, let it be what it will, red or white, fair or foul, you honour him in all, and with joy look for good in this way: give God this honour. Wiſdomes way to great things is in bloud, in the bloud of ſome prime perſons, to the life and welfare of many.</p>
               <p>One or two things may make us give God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the honour of his way to ſuch an end, let his way be never ſo ſad in our eye. God alwayes makes his way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> moſt juſt, to what end ſoever he bends: mercy comes clothed, but like your ſinne, when it comes clothed in ſcarlet, your ſinnes are crimſon ſcarlet ſinnes: you die mercies red and bloudy, 'tis not God. Juſtice treads up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſinne properly, upon man accidentally, as he lies under it; if no body did ly under ſinne, juſtice would tread no body to death, to bring life into the world, nor ſhed a drop of any ones bloud, to bring the greateſt bleſſings to us. God goes after man, becauſe man will not go after God; juſtice follows ſinners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſinners will not follow righteouſneſſe; God doth not ſtep a ſtep in a way of puniſhment, but as you lead him, and to trace
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:113418:31"/>
you in your wayes of ſinne; all wayes of bloud and death, you chalk out to him; you lead love out of his way, and make him become bloudy. God is love, fury is not in him natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but love, he delights not in the death of any; God is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but life, and ſo is his motion naturally, and therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a fountain of life, nothing runnes from him naturally but life; if death runne out of the fountain of life, 'tis becauſe of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon caſt in by you. Generation in bloud, one mercy to die to bring forth another, is ſuch a generation as was not known in the beginning, God never appointed things thus to generate; but life to bring forth life, and ſuch a happy creature, to bring forth ſuch a happy creature, &amp; all happineſſe to live, each ſpeak out fully the vaſtneſſe of the fountain, and the ſimilitude of the ſtream to it. The ſinne of the firſt Adam, coſt the bloud of the ſecond, and all the bloud that ever ſince hath been ſhed, to keep any good alive in the world. Murmuring ſouls you are blind, juſtice ſteres the ſhip, when it ſails in bloud with jewels to you: you would never open your mouths, at all the bloud that is ſhed in the land, no nor at all the bloud that ever hath been ſhed in the world, if your eyes were but open to ſee this firſt thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God makes his way moſt ſure to ſuch an end, let the means propoſed to it, be what they will; through bloud and death, or hell, <hi>I will ſurely do thee good,</hi> ſaith God to Abraham, and yet they muſt into hardſhip ſo much, and ſo long; and yet ſtill the end ſure, and this hart-bleeding condition, the onely ſure way to it, and no other way would have been ſure to ſuch an end. Certainty of an end with us, depends upon the ſtanding or fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch a thing; but the certainty of Gods end which he propoſeth, doth not ſtand upon the ſtanding or falling of this or that, but upon the reſolution of his will, <hi>I will certainly do thee good.</hi> One may die, another may die, and yet whileſt the will of God remains reſolute to ſuch an end, the end will live, and the dying of ſuch prime perſons is onward to it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it could not be. <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away, but not one tittle of Gods will ſhall fall to the ground.</hi> The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Gods intention you ſee, depends upon his will: hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth may die, which are greater bodies then man, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:113418:31"/>
yet Gods intention live, becauſe his will lives. I muſt ſay again, that murmuring ſpirits are blind, they can ſee nothing certain in theſe uncertain times, they think that all that God intends, muſt bleed and die, becauſe all that men intend bleed and die, and the very men too. Blind creatures, the certainty of what God intends, doth not depend upon any of theſe; when all is in bloud and dead, God is alive, and on in his way to his end, the unſpeakable good of many.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God alwayes makes his way moſt honourable to ſuch an end, let difficulties in the way, be what they will; though God may caſt much hardſhip upon us, yet he caſteth no diſgrace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, nor upon his way. <hi>His way is honourable, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt; all his wayes are ſo when he goes in bloud, (for he ſpeaks of the execution of juſtice there) when he goes in the death of one thing, to the life of another, he goes in in ſtate and glory; God is alwayes tender of his name, when he ſeems not tender of any perſon: his ſonne, his onely ſonne, ſcoffed, crowned, hanged, uſed in all the cruelleſt and baſeſt manner that men and devils could deviſe, and yet this ſonne ſo uſed by men, was ſo managed by God and all his hardſhip, that the name of God was made wonderfull honourable in all. Noble perſons ſtand not upon loſſe, but upon their honour, they value not life, they will ſtep every ſtep in bloud, rather then proſecute their deſignes baſely. An honourable ſpirit is naturall to God, he bringeth nothing about baſely, he eyes not the bloud of men, nor the bloud of his ſonne, nor the braveſt bloud that ever ran in bloud veſſels; but what he eyes is the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his will honourably. Murmuring ſpirits! you are blind, and you are baſe, ſo you may but have your own ends, the fafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of your lives and ſtates, you care not how God brings this about, whether honourably or diſhonourably. Unruly hearts are unfit to order weightie matters, ſuch ſpirits muſt be guided by better then their own; what is done with diſhonour to God, ſaves a little bloud and forfeits a great deal. God will manage his way with honour, though he drown and burn worlds, and turn all the creation into bloud. Our ſpirits ſhould move like Gods; that his will may be done by me to his honour. What is my bloud? What iſ God break my back with ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:113418:32"/>
it, and ſqueez out my bloud, ſo that it may but colour his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſcarlet, and honourable.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Finally, God makes his way moſt beneficiall, when moſt bloudy and difficult: Who can expreſſe the benefit that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the Church by the bloud of Chriſt? the like I may ſay of the bloud of Chriſtians, the benefit which redounds to God and to man, is not to be expreſſed. The like I may ſay of the bloud that is now ſhed in England. Truth by fiery trialls is made famous, Chriſt is clothed with ſcarlet, and crowned with glory here; a mans life is his glory, and this gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to Chriſt in flames, is double glory put upon Chriſt; a mans bloud veins, are the lowdeſt trumpets on earth, to ſound out any thing. What a noiſe hath Chriſts bloud made all the world over! And ſo the bloud of Martyrs, is it dried up yet? What virtues and graces ſmell ſo ſweet, and look ſo glorious, as thoſe that are died roſe-colour, with bloud, with the bloud of that earthen breaſt, in which they grow? Bloud hath a very crying voice, it cries up guilt to heaven, and ſo it cries up grace in heaven and earth; it makes Chriſt terrible, holineſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, truth eternall; what is written in bloud never goes out, and all that reade wonder.</p>
               <p>I have but one thing more to ſay, and that is for as much as great things come in a way of hardſhip to fallen man, that you would all prepare for hardſhip. London doſt thou not ſee? England, doſt thou not feel that thy mercies come in bloud? that thy redemption is likely, if ever, to be through much bloud, but through much more then yet is ſhed, who can ſay? Men die dayly, bloudy clouds go up and down, and fall upon this citie and that, and ſhalt thou London eſcape the ſtorm? Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doners, Londoners, are you prepared to welcome in your mercies in bloud? You have had a Thames of water bringing in wealth to you for a great while, are you prepared to have a Thames made of your bloud, to bring in brave wealth to you for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther while? God hath ſtirred up ſome brave ſpirits amongſt you, I would all were ſuch, and yet I ſee many unworthy ſpirits amongſt you; tell ſuch from me, their doom is coming: your bloud is dear, your money dear, but how dear? Dearer to you then Chriſt? then Chriſt will trample upon both. Chriſt is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:113418:32"/>
becauſe we are nigardly, he ſpoils all, money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> goods bloud, becauſe men have no heart to offer all, to bring him in all, to this blind land; yet this men will not do, this men cannot do, till better qualified in heart. The heart muſt have precious principles, ere it will part with its bloud like Chriſt, to bring great favours into the world for others. How noble ſpirited was Chriſt! he had principles, which if you labour after, will make you as he, ready and able to part with your bloud, to bring more of truth into the world: he onely eyed and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the truth of God, and the glory of God: he ſought not his own will, nor his own glory; and therefore ſo eaſily parted with all that was his own, to bring in God and his love to us; let him be your pattern in this, and you will do likewiſe.</p>

               <p>YOu have heard of Chriſt according to the dignity of office, a Redeemer, a redeemer with his bloud; you are now to heare of him according to dignity of perſon, he is as in action ſo in perſon the nobleſt; He <hi>is the image of the inviſible God; the firſt born of every creature.</hi>

                  <hi>Chriſt is admirable in action and perſon,</hi> altogether lovely, ſo in the judgement of God, and ſo in the judgement of thoſe who can diſcern what God, and what the higheſt beauty is; Chriſt hath his encomium here by men truly diſcerning and heare what they ſay, and be taken: For his office 'tis the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt, 'tis to make peace between man and God: for his perſon
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:113418:35"/>
'tis the nobleſt, 'tis the higheſt repreſentation of God that is in this world, no creature in this world yields the like; he makes ſimilitude to him, who otherwiſe is without ſimilitude; if you look at calling, if you look at countenance, if you look at birth, in all theſe he is beyond all: if you look at calling, none is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed like him, for he brings ſouls out of the devils power with his bloud: if you look at countenance, he is the image of that God which is ſo glorious that no mortall eye can behold, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called here <hi>an inviſible God:</hi> if you look at birth, he is Reuben, a firſt born, not in reference to this little family or that, but in reference to Gods great family, which conſiſts of two worlds, three worlds, all that compaſſe and every one of thoſe rooms, which contain <hi>every creature. Who is the image of the inviſible God, the firſt born of every creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some have beauty onely by their place and office, and ſo had Saul, and in this ſenſe merely I think called the beauty of Iſrael, <hi>the beauty of Iſrael is ſlain.</hi> Saul was the ſhame of Iſrael, and the plague of his family, if perſonally and practically conſidered, all his beauty then lay in his chair. So others onely have their beauty in their face and skinne, as Abſolon; and others in their birth and pedigree, as Eſau, all over rude and hairy, a rough man, but of a beautifull ſtock, the firſt-born of a brave family: ſome have all theſe beauties without, but none within, of a good family, of a good countenance, of a good rank, but not of one good quality; but none of theſe are wanting in Chriſt, he hath a generall beauty: in place a King, in countenance the image of God, in birth <hi>primogenitus cunctae creaturae,</hi> inſide and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, both are as beautifull as the other, his goodneſſe as beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full as his greatneſſe; therefore both are joyned together by the Prophet Zachary, and admired, <hi>How great is his goodneſſe, and how great is his beauty?</hi> Zach. 9.17. Chriſts goodneſſe is admirably glorious and beautifull, as any other beauty ſo is the beauty both of inſide and outſide of every thing belonging to Chriſt, and here loftily expreſſed, and admired: <hi>Who is the image of the inviſible God, the first born of everie crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The admirableneſſe of Chriſts perſon makes the admirable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his action; as things are made ſo they act, he is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:113418:35"/>
made, and therefore incomparably acts, he is made higher then the heavens, and therefore of more power and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in action then they, though they be moſt admirable bodies in the world in operation. Chriſt is in his form more noble then the heavens, thoſe nobleſt bodies; according to the nobility of form ſo is action, and therefore are his actions mentioned in that place, as all ſuitable to this ſupreame form, wherefore he is ſaid to ſave to the uttermoſt for evermore: which action is ſuitable to his form: he is made of an everlaſting ſhape, <hi>above the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;</hi> theſe laſt a great while, but he longer, becauſe higher, and becauſe made above them; the heavens can make no everlaſting operation, becauſe they have no everlaſting form; but Chriſt being made above them, he acts above them, and produceth everlaſting things ſuitable to his form. See this argumentation uſed by the ſpirit of God himſelf, Hebr. 7.25, 26. <hi>Wherefore he is able to ſave them to the utmoſt,</hi> that is, <hi>for ever, that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them: for ſuch an high Prieſt became us, who is holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners, and made higher then the heavens.</hi> Chriſt is made higher then the heavens, and therefore can produce higher effects; he is made as high as the Higheſt; and therefore ſuitable to him in action: he redeems from hell, from the torturing power, not onely of men, but of devils. Alike place is that, Luke 1.32. <hi>He ſhall be great, and ſhall be called the Sonne of the Higheſt,</hi> as things are in the greatneſſe and glory of their birth and formation, ſo in the greatneſſe and glory of their action; if a Sonne of the Higheſt, he will do the higheſt things, things incomparably great, all ſhall ſee it and ſay ſo: if in the image and form of God, and equall to him, he will do equall to him, things which no man can do, deſtroy principalities and powers, and lift ſouls out of hell to heaven. This lies along in the ſtory here: <hi>In whom we have redemption through his bloud, the forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, who is the image cf the inviſible God, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Complement is to expreſſe and to gain love; Chriſt is in perſon and action complete, to expreſſe and gain affection. God is inviſible, and hath no image nor lively expreſſion of himſelf but Chriſt, what he is for wiſdome, for power, for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:113418:36"/>
all theſe are out of ſight, and have no expreſſion, but in Chriſt; the excellency of an inviſible God, ſhines viſibly, and expreſſely in him, in his perſon and in his action, and this to gain man unto him, and therefore is it ſaid after the mentioning of his endowments, <hi>his name ſhall be called Wonderfull, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellour, the mighty God:</hi> the government ſhall be laid upon his ſhoulders, and then he ſhall be called this and that, &amp;c. Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent honour ſhall be put upon him by God, and this to gain the like from men, they ſhall call Chriſt as God hath made him and indowed him, as they ſee the image of God in him, his wiſdome, his power, his love. Inviſible things do not work upon ſenſible creatures, therefore are the inviſible things of God made viſible in Chriſt, in his perſon and in his action, and this to work and winne; therefore are all the beauties of Chriſt ſo exactly and ſo loftily related; it is the myſtery of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles art here, in drawing out God in Chriſt, and telling you who Chriſt is like, that he might draw love to both. The fumme of all is this, <hi>Chriſt is admirable both in perſon and action.</hi>

Chriſt hath a generall beautie, and this particularly expreſſed, firſt his image, &amp; then his birth, and therefore are according to his own order of expreſſion to be proſecuted. <hi>Who is the image,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The image of God ſignifies ſeverall things, ſometime ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude in place, and ſometime ſimilitude in qualification. Chriſt is the image of God in majeſtie, in purity, in ſimplicity, and Identity of being: I intend to touch all theſe, and then give
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:113418:37"/>
you the uſe. Chriſt holds forth the majeſty of God to man: di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine majeſty notes two things, infinite power, and wiſdome, and Chriſt carries both theſe through the world in open view, which none elſe do, neither man nor Angel. What they falſly ſaid of Simon the ſorcerer, that I may truly ſay of Chriſt, <hi>He is the great power of God,</hi> he hath power over all fleſh, over all ſpirits; men, devils, winds, ſeas, are all ſubject to him. Chriſt makes every knee bow to him, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and under earth, <hi>he is the head of all principallitie and power,</hi> Coloſſ. 2.10. Chriſt moves in an upper ſphere, and moves all other after him, as he pleaſeth, he ſits in heaven and doth what ſoever he will, he puts forth an infinite power here, which I wonder this world can bear, and manages all things according to the counſell of his will, which is one beam of God: divine power working fully as it is, according to its infinite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture infinitely; and ſo it works in none, nor by none, but in and by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Infinite power, puts forth in infinite wiſdome, that's the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete majeſty of God, and both theſe in Chriſt, and no where elſe. Chriſt is the <hi>power of God,</hi> and the <hi>wiſdome of God,</hi> and both joyned together by the Apoſtle, as alwayes going forth together to man. But unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks, <hi>Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdome of God.</hi> Chriſt hath an almighty arm, and an almighty brain, he over-reaches all, the deceived and the deceiver; no action of his proves an abortive, or looſes one whit of its ſcope or intention for want of due time, or due place, or any other oportune, and ſeaſonable circumſtance. <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge.</hi> There is not any excellency accidentall in Chriſt, ſo you are not to underſtand the term <hi>hid,</hi> but all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of power and wiſdome, wrapt up in fleſh naturally, in him there is <hi>the fulneſſe of the God-head bodily.</hi> 'Tis an alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to treaſure, where it lies naturally hid in the earth in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per body; and there lies aboundance of treaſures, after an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſable meaſure: ſo in Chriſt lies wrapt up, wiſdome, and knowledge, in their full dimenſions, and according to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible nature, as in a proper body, and anſwerably work to the managing of power, and therefore is it ſaid, that
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:113418:37"/>
                  <hi>he did all things well,</hi> and that <hi>he spake and did, as never man did.</hi> The power of God fully as 'tis, and the wiſdome of God, according to its naturality, and immenſity of being and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which makes up the majeſty of God, and ſo one part of the image of God in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Chriſt is the image of God, as in majeſty, ſo in purity: juſtice and mercy are the purity of God, as power and wiſdome are the majeſty of God; Chriſt, as he is the power of God, and the wiſdome of God, ſo he is the juſtice and the mercy of God, he is <hi>grace and truth,</hi> and the fulneſſe of theſe in view. And the word was made fleſh, and dwelt amongſt us, and we beheld his glory, as the glory of the onely begotten of the Father, <hi>full of grace and truth.</hi> Providence is full of variety of action, and all very profound, one cannot feel bottom here, yet this we can pitch upon, that grace and truth are the ſcope of them all: <hi>the works of Gods hands are veritie and judgement; all his Laws are ſure, and ſtand fast for ever, and they are done in truth and uprightneſſe.</hi> Chriſts action is oft beyond our apprehenſion, and contrary to our expectation, but never beyond, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to grace and truth. Grace goes forth in truth, mercy is managed by juſtice; love is tendred, and if abuſed, wrath cuts off that perſon, or that people, and this is the carriage of Chriſt through the world. Grace and truth are the nature of God, and theſe in fulneſſe, are in the perſon and action of Chriſt, which plainly ſpeaks out what Chriſt is, to all the world. Under this notion is Chriſt called the image of God. Holineſſe and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, was called Gods image in Adam, becauſe this was in his perſon and action createdly exact, but this is uncreatedly exact in the ſecond Adam, which gives him this high title in the text; the image of the inviſible God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Finally, Chriſt is the image of God, as in majeſty and puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo in ſimplicity of being: according to his divinity, he is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially the ſame with the inviſible God, and therefore called by the Authour to the Hebrews, the engraven character of his perſon or the figure of his ſubſtance, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, the character of his ſubſtance, and under this notion Chriſt hath the attributes of God given him, and called as he is, <hi>a king e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, immortall, inviſible.</hi> Before Abraham was, Chriſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:113418:38"/>
was, before any creature was, Chriſt was; in the beginning was the word. Chriſt was that word which began all, and will be that word which ſhall end all, he is Alpha and Omega, but without beginning or end of dayes himſelf: by him all things are made, and by him all things ſhall be deſtroyed, but he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf abideth for ever, as God doth.</p>

Spirits have no fleſh and bloud, no dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matter, becauſe no mixture. Chriſts divine nature is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and the ſpirituality of his being, not infinite as Angels, but infinite as God, and in this ſence, above the reach of ſence, and much more above the injury of finite force, and therefore called both <hi>immortall and inviſible. And ſo the expreſſe image of Gods perſon, and the brightneſſe of his glory.</hi> The ſumme of all is this, <hi>that Chriſt is that perſon in the trinity, which doth moſt immediately and fully, hold forth God to mans obſervation and uſe, for temporall and eternall good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As Chriſt is the image of God in purity, ſo we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to him. <hi>Whom he did fore-know, he did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his ſonne,</hi> that is, in purity, in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and holineſſe, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Put on the new man which after God, is created in righteouſneſſe, and true holineſſe.</hi> Sinners look well upon your ſouls, who are they like, Chriſt or Sathan? Sathan knows who are like him, and ſo doth Chriſt, neither will he be deceived, therefore deceive not your ſelves: Death is at your doore, do you not ſee him; after him, the next diſpatch will be for eternity, and it will bear but upon the reſolution of this queſtion; whoſe image and ſuperſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is upon this ſoul? If you would ſeek to delude at that day, it will not do in the leaſt, for conſcience then ſhall manage its office fully, without any confront from an unſound heart, it ſhall ſpeak out then, and unmask the face of the inward man to the judge of all. Deluded ſouls, I dread to think of you, you have uſed a damnable art a great while, to mask a naughty heart, and a naughty life, this trade muſt down now; the ſword of the Lords vengeance is come to rip you up, you ſhall be known as you are, judged as you are. This man is as like the

Devil in heart, as he can look, let children ſwimme home to their father in bloud, I will make no better conveyance for them. Let them have marſhall law, will the Lord of hoſts ſay, ſlay them in their beds, ſlay them at their doors; uggly ſouls, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not endure any longer to look upon them. But as for you that bear the image of Chriſt, lift up your heads, ſing for joy of heart now, though all the land be ſo ſad. Chriſts image is his mark upon you for mercy, he will know you by this, in the midſt of the bloudieſt battell, in the midſt of a fired citie.

God will have what is in the heart, under the mans hand to condemne him: <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsing themſelves to be wiſe, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God, into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and foure-footed beaſts,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. Firſt they became vain in imagination, then in action; the idol of the heart begins the idol of the hand, and outward man neceſſarily: if you would know any mans conception of God, look upon his action, if you would know what idol is in any mans heart, be but patient a while, and he will draw it out himſelf in his life. How Romaniſts conceive of God, they give it you under their hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the many ſenſuall helps they uſe in their devotion, their images, and multitudes of carnall repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, whereas God is a ſpirit, and under the ſame notion and apprehenſion alone, muſt be worſhipped. Carnality ſpeaks corruptibility, and that is admirable abominable to relieve ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion by, reſpecting an incorruptible God, and yet this is the abomination of Rome, and the perſons which we ſtand to defend our ſelves againſt at this day.</p>
               <p>Men which have corrupted their own glory, ſtrive to corrupt infinite glory, let this ſet an edge upon every mans ſword: I go forth againſt a company of carnall worſhippers, which deſtroy God, which change the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to corruptible man. I know not what fire this puts in your ſpirits, I know what fire it kindles in Gods ſpirit, namely, jealouſie which is a kind of unquenchable fire, which burns to the third and fourth generation, and which nothing quencheth, but the bloud of them that kindle it; ſhed this when called to it, or elſe God will, and yours too. Read the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this generation, Revel. 14.9. <hi>If any man worſhip the beaſt and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand, the ſame ſhall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is powred out without mixture into the cup of his indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnation, and he ſhall be tormented with fire and brimſtone in the preſence of the holy angels, and in the preſence of the holy Lambe.</hi> Falſe repreſentation makes falſe adoration, and our kingdome is full of this, and we have done little ſpiritually to give better inſtruction, and therefore 'tis no wonder that we fall

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> You ſee now that God is inviſible in action, in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is moſt ſeeable, and therefore I thinke you will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe he is ſo in perſon; the materiality of his being, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity of his being, and the glory of being, which reſults from both the former, neceſſarily render him inviſible to us.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:113418:41"/>
God is not onely inviſible in regard of his eſſence or god-head, but alſo in regard of the fulneſſe and glory thereof, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>light indeed</hi> in the Scripture, but yet ſuch as to which no mortall eye can approch.

                  </label> Each of theſe are diſtinctly uſefull: that God is inviſible in action tremble before him. Sinners look not after their ſouls, I tremble to ſee it, becauſe there lies the action of God principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a man is killed inviſibly. Sinne is beſt pleaſing, the man will have his way, now God with-draws, and this action is not ſeen, but yet is the eternall death of a ſoul: thouſands are thus ſlain, and no wounds ſeen, felt nor complained of. There be a great many bodies viſibly ſlain, and this makes you ſhake; but there be a great many ſouls inviſibly ſlain, the ſword of the ſpirit cuts off the ſpirits of men utterly from God apace, therefore is hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie at ſuch a helliſh height, and ſo many great men become as devils, and making damnation a court-complement. There be a great many ſlain and fallen, but weep not for theſe; there be a great many more ſlain that are not yet fallen, inviſibly ſlain utterly cut off from God; O weep for theſe, for when theſe fall they will fall very low. Fear not, Chriſtian, they have their deaths wound that warre againſt you, a deadly wound at heart from heaven which you ſee not; ſtand ſtill and you will ſee them
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:113418:41"/>
fall fearfully, hell pangs are upon them; do you not hear them grone to be there, by their horride imprecations? Our warre hath ſlain more then we ſee, how do men give up the holy Ghoſt daily! and ſouls breathe out their laſt good breath! What making of graves, tolling and ringing out is there in the other world below, if a man could ſee it! Sinners, tremble at theſe things, for I tremble to think of ſome of you: I ſee that in ſome of you, which I fear is yet inviſible to your ſouls, inviſible judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary action upon your ſouls, beg that your eyes may be opened that you may ſee Gods actions within you in ſome meaſure, or you are loſt men.</p>
               <p>Gods action is inviſible, truſt in him: when Gods action car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries not that in it viſibly, which we look for, we think it hath nothing in it at all, nor means nothing for our good, and ſo let fall faith, and fall a quarrelling with God and one another; 'tis our great diſadvantage at this day and nothing more, with which God is diſpleaſed, which will be more and more diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to us onely. <hi>Why ſayeſt thou, O Jacob, and ſpeakest O Iſrael, my way is hid from the Lord, and my judgement is paſſed over from my God?</hi> When we cannot ſee God going along with us in every thing, we think he hath caſt us off; the godly deſpair, and the wicked preſume when things are thus carried, both which are much alike good; one looſeth his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, the other looſeth his ſoul. When we are in the dark and know not where we are, God knows where he is, variation of action doth not prove variation of intention; one end may be intended in travell, though every day the way turn. In coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys full of mountains, wayes are neceſſitated to turn and take compaſſe much: there are great mountains in the Churches way, theſe make many turnings, and put us oft to a ſtand, to ſee our way, and him that goes before us. Chriſtians, be not diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it is the manner of God to hide himſelf oft, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to ſhew his face gloriouſly. I cannot let down my faith reſpecting Gods intentions of love, to this bleeding land: that that God now hides himſelf let it make matter of prayer, as it did to David in like caſe, and not matter of unbelief and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: <hi>Hide not thy face from thy ſervant, for I am in trouble: heare me ſpeedily, &amp; deliver me out of the mire, and let me not
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:113418:42"/>
ſink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters: let not the water-flouds overflow me, neither let the deep ſwallow me in, let not the pit ſhut her mouth upon me, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Finally, for as much as God according to perſon is inviſible to a mortall eye; long to be out of the body, that mortality may put on immortality, a mortall eye, become an immortall eye, that you may ſee him that dwells in that light, to which no mortall eye can reach. The body makes miſery, and not felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the ſoul here; our mortall eye beholds nothing but mortality, and ſo all our viſion in the body, makes miſery, and not felicity to the ſoul. What is this world but a great body filled with the curſe of God! and what are all the creatures of this world but each others deadly executioners, and the duſt of one, a grave to turn another into the ſame! and this is our dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full viſion throughout our dying life here; our eye affects, and afflicts our hearts, and yet do not we long to go home, to have better viſion, the viſion of Saints, and the viſion of Angels and the viſion of God, in which is heaven. Know your errour now, you carnall wretches: all is going away, whither are your ſouls going, to ſee God, or the devil? Know your errour Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, the glory of this world hath taken your eye, and the ſhame of it will take your perſons, unleſſe the Lord pitty.

In this ſence,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:113418:42"/>
namely, in regard of precedence in affection, is Iſrael called Gods firſt-born, that is, in reference to all other people, the firſt choſen and beloved: <hi>And thou ſhalt ſay unto Pharaoh, thus ſaith the Lord, Iſrael is my ſonne, even [my firſt-born] Let my ſonne, my firſt-born go, or elſe I will ſlay thy firſt-born,</hi> Exodus 4.22.</p>

                  <hi>Birth-right is an honourable thing, and to be holden up, and maintained.</hi> 'Tis taken for granted to be honourable, and to be maintained, and therefore is ſo uſed and proſecuted in reference to Chriſt: what is due to him by birth in a ſpirituall ſence, is held forth and maintained, to wit, that he is the <hi>first-born of many brethren;</hi> and what is due to him by birth in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſence is held forth, and maintained alſo, that he is the firſt-born of <hi>every creature:</hi> all his priviledges are proteſted.</p>
               <p>Right is the priviledge of being, and felicity falls as this falls; a being without priviledge, is a being without felicity; and a being without felicity, is hell. Birth-right contains much: <hi>'tis a bundle of priviledges bound up by God and man, as many as grace and nature affords, to make ſuch a being bleſſed, both here and hereafter.</hi> Conſider a man as born, and he hath ſuch natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall priviledge from nature: and conſider a man as new born, and he hath ſuch ſpirituall priviledge from grace.

Propriety confounded, Ahabs and Naboths vineyard become one, heaven and hell become one, children and dogges would fare alike, which is ſad confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and which nature abhorres, and grace much more.

being not onely from the hand of God, but from the heart of God, <hi>born of water and the spirit, brought forth to the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Goſpel,</hi> by a ſpirituall efficacy in the word: if this be not your condition, your honour is not full, whatever your worldly priviledge be, and you will ſoon know it; for though you ſeem to be ſons made much of, you will quickly be caſt off; none but firſt-born are <hi>written in heaven,</hi> and imbraced for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>To the Church of the firſt-born [written in heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt-born have a propriety in eternall felicity, they are <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in heaven,</hi> and others are written in hell; they are joynt heirs with Chriſt, which a ſtate worth the looking after. You ſee how all things go here, tyrannie tramples your priviledge under foot; you are born to much, and it comes to nothing but bloud and miſerie; you dare not go where your revenue lies, to challenge your birth-right, the ſword is ſo furbiſht and ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you: had you a ſtate in grace, were you a generation of firſt-born as Chriſt, there were ſomething ſure to take too, let times and things work as they will. The folly of men is great, this world is onely prized, and men will not be reclaimed, which is a deſtructive thing. Let me ask the children of this world, doth the bloudy ſword make you queſtion your ſtate, whether you are the children of God or no? born of the ſpirit, to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance eternall, immortall, that paſſeth not away? New-born are firſt-born: you are as you were in life, and you will be as you never were in death. Do ye ſee children of this world, how black and bloudy this world is? But what's that to come, where your names are written, and unto which, you are heirs! Look about you children of this world, your miſery gathers every day more and more, and nearer and nearer, and it will ſwallow you up, and feed upon you for ever, if not prevented; your birth-right is barely naturall, that is, ſuch priviledges, in ſuch a kingdome; and you had need fight hard for theſe; for you have no more, theſe gone, and all gone, looſe what you are born to of fleſh and bloud, and you looſe all: fight hard carnall creatures, or you will be quite undone elſe.</p>
               <p>Birth-right is honourable and to be maintained: you that have this honour in a full ſence, in a naturall and in a divine ſence, as Chriſt had, hold up your honour, and maintain it as
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:113418:44"/>
Chriſt doth here by his ſpirit, in my text: aſſert your ſtate, as Chriſt doth here, and not deſert it: tell the children of this world what you are, children of ſuch men, and children of ſuch a God, that you are born to ſuch ſecular priviledge by man, and to ſuch ſpirituall priviledge by God, and will maintain it in his way, as long as bloud is in your veins. 'Tis below a man to be a ſlave: uſurped power, makes illegall yokes, and the man that will put his neck into theſe, is an aſſe, a ſilly beaſt, and not a man: as the poſterity of Iſſachar are called upon this very ground. The ſoul is baſe, as it yields to baſeneſſe, it fears man more then God, which will be its ruine without remedy: a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued ſpirit in this ſence, is a ſilly dove, without heart, of weak principles, and of an unſound mind: ſo many trialls, and ſo many plagues to this man, all that is ſhot at him hits him to the heart, and kills him dead: this is our miſery at this day, we have a great many perſons, but a few men, a great deal of ſtirre but no action; the enemy at the gate, birth-right giving up, corporall priviledge, and ſpirituall priviledge, wounded at the heart, and yet we have no heart to do our duty; ſomething loſt makes us conclude all is loſt; every one kills himſelf with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, that there is none to kill them, which kill Law, Religion, and all goodneſſe. Our colour is fallen ſtrangely of a ſudden: what a deal of bloud and life had we to ſtand for the honour of our birth-right, a little while ſince! and what's now become of it? hath harlots got it all away from our army, and from our citie too? I can look upon no mans face, but their ſits a pale deadly ſpirit. Ah Lord! how gaſtly 'tis! What doth it preſage? the death of all? Londoners, what do you mean? will you let frogges and toads creep into your houſes, and up into your beds, ere you will ſtirre and put forth for your birth-right? ſhall the enemy come and write up your baſeneſſe at your doore, in your own bloud.</p>
               <p>Braveneſſe of ſpirit for the maintenance of our priviledge is much wanting, and yet I doubt will be, there is ſo much carnall bravery. Our armies ſwagger, every ſtreet ſtares upon their pride; pride ſeeks it ſelf, and not Chriſt, nor any thing that's noble. Men go forth to maintain themſelves, and not to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain right: how much do many men ſwagger, now Chriſt is
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:113418:44"/>
turned out of all! Unſound hearts ſwell: pride is a fruit of rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenneſſe, rotten wretches intruſted, have undone all: are not our lives now in as much danger as our liberties? We may thank our ſelves, ſhould we not have choſen ſincere humble men to lead us forth, to ſtand for our birth-right in the field? Humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and integrity are the foundation of true valour; others va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour, but theſe will be brave indeed. Look to your hearts every one, I think it will come to every mans turn to ſtand for his birth-right. When man by man ſhall be ſingled out, triall will be quick: When the ſword is at the breaſt, for whom art thou? for the King, or for the Parliament? for Antichriſt or for Chriſt? Your hearts will ſhake unleſſe very ſound. As you find your unſoundneſſe, make out for healing, you will betray all elſe when put to it to ſtand for your birth-right; you will like Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in ſtead of profeſſing Chriſt, profeſſe that you know him not.</p>

He that cometh down from heaven is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. <hi>He that is of the earth is earthly, and ſpeaketh of the earth; but he that cometh down from heaven is above all; and what he hath ſeen and heard, that he teſtifieth, and yet no man receives his teſtimony,</hi> John 3. Twice is the ſoveraignty of Chriſt affirmed, and yet not once received; he lifteth and lifteth again to lift up thoughts and affections concerning Chriſt, as one above all, and yet all would not do. <hi>He that comes down from heaven is above all;</hi> above all on earth, and above all in heaven. He multiplies high expreſſion to raiſe high conception, and yet poore low creatures would conceive of him no otherwiſe then of other men, nor yet hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo well. Thus are high expreſsions multiplied here for the ſame end, which argues that man is a creature very apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive very low of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> We are carnall and judge ſo; we frame conception from ſenſe, objects are no otherwiſe then we ſee. Chriſts out-ſide ſpake as little as anothers, and leſſe, low in condition, and low in eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, this is naturall to man, and hard to do otherwiſe. Thoughts muſt have a foot-ſtool from the world, to lift up themſelves reſpecting perſons: we lift up things no otherwiſe then they lift up themſelves by externall advantage. Chriſts glory is not in this world, he comes in form of a man, and therefore judged no more; in form of a mean man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:113418:46"/>
meanly judged of. What Chriſt is viſibly is looked after, and this is little; nothing viſible ſpeaks him the authour of invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, the maker of thrones and dominions: from nothing viſible, fleſh and bloud can argue nothing reall, to raiſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion reſpecting any thing, no not reſpecting God himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> We ſet up things as we ſee them, and we ſet up things as we love them. Man will not conceive highly of that which he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth: man is carnall and malicious, he makes judgement ſubject to ſenſe, yea he debaſeth it lower, he makes judgement ſubject to malice. None ſo blind as thoſe that will not ſee; yes, thoſe that ſcorn to ſee, Conviction is ſtrong, and may do ſomething upon the will, if it do but merely nill; but is not ſtrong enough to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-bear malice. The Scribes and Phariſies ſaw more of Chriſt then a mere man, and yet will take in no thought of him but what they pleaſed; they eſteemed of him as a devil, ſuch was their malice, when convinced he was a God, the maker of all, and above all, Angels and men. Divine rules croſſe carnall, a carnall ſpirit croſſed is a devil, a devil calls Chriſt Belzebub, the chief of devils, and not the chief of bleſſed beings, as here the Apoſtle doth.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> We ſet up things as we will, and yet as God will too. Men ſtumble at Chriſt from what they pleaſe, and ruine their ſouls, and this is according to Gods judiciary will, for he hath ſaid it ſhall be ſo, yea that it ſhall be ſo to many. Chriſt is for a ſtone of ſtumbling, and for a rock of offence to both the houſes of Iſrael, <hi>and many of them ſhall ſtumble and fall and be broke,</hi> that is, many ſhall have low thoughts of Chriſt, and ſo reject him, which is death without remedy. Chriſt is not carnally plauſible, and it is ſo ordered of purpoſe for a ſnare to carnall wretches, which will ſet up nothing but what the world doth, and to accompliſh judiciary will. Man eyes his will, and ſo doth God: man orders all his actions according to this, and ſo doth God: ſinners fulfill their own wills and Gods, when they ſet Chriſt low, and their ſouls lower, when they ſtumble at Chriſt, and ruine themſelves. You vex not God when ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe Chriſt, and deſtroy your ſouls, you onely accompliſh his righteous will, and your own wicked will.</p>
               <p>Conſider the point in hand, and how it reacheth you: Chriſt

is a mere fancy to forlorn ſouls. Men oppoſe creature to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, this is higher then that, and this is better then that, but who oppoſeth Chriſt to all the creatures, and ſets him in his thoughts above all, above earth and above heaven, above viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and above inviſible things, above thrones and dominions, above every being as the being thereof? Soveraignty is peculiar ſtate, Chriſt muſt have glory in the higheſt; that ſalutation was but due which they gave when Chriſt came into Jeruſalem; <hi>Bleſſed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord, peace in heaven, and [glory in the higheſt.</hi> Chriſt ſet higheſt in the ſoul, is ſet no higher then he ſhould be, the king is but ſet in his throne: men fancie that they thus ſet up Chriſt in their thoughts, but they do but fancy it I doubt. I will give you ſome things to demonſtrate where this is reall, that the ſoul doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as the Apoſtle here, look upon Chriſt as ſupreme and above all.</p>

Job did but fancie this point before that he apprehended God as over all, but now he comes indeed to behold it, his heart ſhakes, and he draws doctrine upon doctrine from it. I know that he which is over all can do what ever he will: he made me of the duſt with his word, and he can turn me to duſt with his word. I cannot hide a fault from him; <hi>he that made the eare, ſhall he not heare,</hi> if I ſpeak ſin? <hi>he that made the eye, ſhall he not ſee,</hi> I do ſin? and he that made the heart, ſhall not he diſcern if I think ſinne?

he is <hi>precious:</hi> if I ſee him the ſonne of the higheſt, I give glory in the higheſt <hi>to him.</hi> As things are in height ſo in honour; honour carries glory, and glory carries the heart; the one ſeen, and the other is more ſeen, and ſwayes; glory is a very taking thing: <hi>The Lord is high above all nations, and his glory is above the heavens.</hi> If I indeed behold the perſon of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the earth, and above the heaven, I ſee him in glory above all theſe; and if I ſee him in glory above all theſe, I am taken with him above all.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Soveraigntie holds forth remedie, ſoveraignty is ſoveraigne; the ſoul in the midſt of all toſſings knows where to reſt: per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons very high oppoſe me, yet there are <hi>higher then the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> that is the quieting argument. <hi>If thou ſeeſt the oppreſſion of the poore, and violent perverting of judgement in the Province, marvell not at it, for he that is higher then the higheſt regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and there be higher then they.</hi> The ſoveraignty of Chriſt indeed beheld, takes off diſquiet, though powers oppoſing be never ſo great; the ſoul can argue with its fears, and find out ſhoulders for his burthens, as long as God is above all. He that made all is above all, and will maintain his univerſall ſoveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; the higheſt ſhall know they have one above them, and here the oppreſſed reſt. A man that indeed looks upon. God as a Creatour, reſts his ſoul upon him as a faithfull Creatour, that is, as one that will regard the beings which he hath made, although various and ſo many. Great troubles make great fears, and great fears make great ſhifts and ſinnes: What a fearfull time, and what a ſinfull time is this! Princes are but men, and yet humane ſoveraignty makes us do any thing. Fearfull ſouls, you do but fancie Chriſts ſoveraignty, that he is King of kings, and the Creatour of all; you have no apprehenſion of what you ſpeak: you fear God and offer to Baal, as the expreſſion is, that is, you ſet man above Chriſt, what ever you ſay.</p>
               <p>Some of you may poſſibly ſee your ſinne by this point, that you are not ſo noble ſpirited as you dreamt, that you have but low conception of Chriſt. You that are proud in ſpirit, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in affection, and fearfull of men, have a baſe and low opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:113418:48"/>
of Chriſt, and Chriſt will require it. As long as God is ſupream, a brave ſpirit flincheth not a ſtep, but others do like themſelves, which will be their ſhame and judgement. <hi>He judgeth thoſe that are high,</hi> ſaith brave Job to his friends, which carried themſelves high, Job 21.22. he ſaw his oppoſites high, yet this daunted him not a jot, becauſe he beheld one higher. Judge not light of this point in hand, you cannot heare one more uſefull in this trying time. A man fears no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that ſees Chriſt above all, neither what men can ſay nor do; a man fears where no fear is that ſees not this: <hi>Alſo now behold my witneſſe is in heaven, and my record is on high; my friends ſcorn me, but mine eye poureth out tears unto God,</hi> Job 16.19, 20. Men think of me thus and thus, but it troubles me not a jot, I look at one that is above all men, that made all, and knows all, and will judge all; to him I referre all: all can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not daunt one in good that ſees God above all. Low ſouls, look upon him that is high if you would become high, as high as Chriſt and heaven.</p>

                  <hi>A holy ſoul cannot tire it ſelf in the contemplation of Christ.</hi> Their is variety of excellencie in Chriſt; varietie of time, he is <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Varietie.</note> variety of beautie, white and ruddie: varietie of qualitie, mild and fierce; a lion and a lamb, a ſervant and a ſonne, a Man and God, a Redeemer and a Creatour. Chriſt is all varietie of excellency, he hath <hi>all the powders of the Merchants,</hi> Canticles 3.6. In things below Chriſt, ſome have excellency, and ſome none: ſome this excellency, and ſome that, but none have all; and this checks the ſoul in his game, and withers contemplation at the root. Contemplation is ſoul-recreation, recreation is kept up by variety: one thing tires quickly, unleſſe that one be all, which ſo is Chriſt and none elſe, <hi>he is all,</hi> Coloſſians, 3.11. All belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to well being, and all belonging to being, Redeemer and Creatour, <hi>for by him were all things created.</hi>

               <p>There is congruity of excellency in Chriſt:<note place="margin">Congruity</note> what things are in Chriſt are all ſuitable to a holy ſoul, and ſuitable things tire not; we lie down where we are pleaſed. 'Tis with a holy ſoul, as 'tis with a holy God; unſuitable things tire him preſently. <hi>Your new moons, and your appointed feasts,</hi> that is, their hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical obſervations, <hi>I am weary to beare them,</hi> ſaith God, Eſay, 1.14. Holy perſons, and holy actions, things congruous to his will, in theſe he takes up his dwelling; his thoughts though vaſt and noble hire themſelves here, ſo farre are ſuch things from wearying of him; his thoughts reſpecting this world, the people, and practices of it, rove and wander, and tire, as weary of all, till he come to Sion, and then obſerve what he ſaith of her; <hi>This is my reſt for ever, here will I dwell, for I have deſired it,</hi> Pſalme, 132.14. Affection makes motion, and thoughts go af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deſires; deſires ſuited, thoughts ſit down and take up their reſt, and their dwelling, and like the place of their habitation: 'tis thus with God, and 'tis thus with godly men: one holy ſpirit roves and tires out it ſelf, till it meet with another; the ſoul of a chriſtian flies from creature to creature, and pitches down upon this and that, but riſes up again preſently as one wearied, becauſe it can find nothing ſuitable; and thus it doth in reference to all the creatures, till it come to Chriſt, and in him it finds all ſuitableneſſe, and then ſitteth down, ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</note>There is tranſcendency of excellency in Chriſt: variety and congruity of excellency, and all above expreſſion, more then can be reached. A holy heart is deep, and loves to bath it ſelf in deep waters: contemplation is a ſoul making one deep to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low up another; and this is ſo farre from tiring, that 'tis the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heaven of a holy heart. Contemplation is a ſoul widening it ſelf to ſwallow up infiniteneſſe, what ever God is, if it can. Not a ſtep of Chriſt towards man, but 'tis a great deep. Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a great deep, and Creation a great deep, and 'tis delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to a divine heart to dive where ſweetneſſe hath no bottome. Carnall contemplation tires: becauſe though it find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſuitable in the creature, yet but very little, and that little in a little time turns to nothing, and then the ſoul is not ohely tired, but vexed, which makes thoughts retreat diſorderly. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine contemplation cannot tire, for it finds out ſuitable things, and yet there are more beſides theſe ſtill; it finds out one Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and when the ſoul is in this, and it ſeeth another beyond this; when it beholdeth a Redeemer, it ſeeth a Creatour more plainly.</p>

                  </label> This point plainly diſcovers many hearts not to be holy; divine contemplation is ſo burthenſome and tireſome to them. You have vagabond perſons, ſo you have vagabond ſpirits, which had rather be any where then at home. Chriſt and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are the ſouls home, thoughts and ſpirits are all vagabonds whileſt they are from this home, and yet few ſouls care to get here and keep here. The ſoul is ſublime of it ſelf but pravitie bowes it down; men have their corruptions, and theſe make their thoughts <hi>cleave to the duſt.</hi> You do not obſerve whither your hearts go, nor what journeyes they make; you do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their going out, nor their layings out, whither they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; nor how prodigall when abroad; nor poſſible will not, becauſe 'tis pleaſing: men do contentedly loſe their ſouls in things below Chriſt.</p>

cannot dwell upon nothing. Thoughts are ſoon tired when confounded; they claſh much where there is no apprehenſion; one fighteth againſt another, and the ſpirit dieth in this fight, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe condemned to abide in a dungeon. Confuſion makes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, diſtraction makes madneſſe; men throw off all, when they can underſtand nothing in divine myſteries; and I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf that this hath undone many a ſoul. I have known learned men, who though conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plative enough in their way, yet when they ſet to conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plate divine things can make no ſweetnes to their ſouls, but knots, tricks, and fancies to cavill with; and 'tis impoſſible but that the ſoul ſhould tire quickly, that can find out nothing in Chriſt but knots and bones to feed on. Learned perſons look about you, your contemplation is higheſt and yet loweſt; the hid things of nature wrap you up, and the high things of Chriſt tire you preſently, which is nought, and ſpeaks the heart bewitcht with curioſity; high in fancie, but low and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall in affection: ſuch a ſoul as this makes its neſt in the ſtarrs of this world, but God will from thence pluck it down; every ſoul that neſts not it ſelf in Chriſt, and in thoſe glorious excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies which ſhine in him will be judged, and periſh as car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As ignorance ſo idleneſſe deſtroyes divine contemplation: thoughts are vain, they muſt be watcht; man hath power to obſerve his ſpirit which beaſts have not. <hi>The ſpirit of a man, knowes the things of a man.</hi> You know how carnally your hearts work, and what do you do to reduce them? You keep no watch, ſloth-betrayes your ſouls to luſt, and luſt will betray your ſouls to the devill. How ſecretly doth many a mans heart ſteal away Chriſt, and yet not ſo ſecretly but 'tis ſeen, and the man for want of activity lets it go, and ſo is acceſſary to the betraying of his own ſoul, Ah Lord! what will that man be able to ſay for himſelf in judgement, that ſtood ſtill and ſaw his heart ſteal away from God to the creature, and did nothing to turn it back, made no prayer, nor ſhed no tears! Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of loſſes now, but who complains; O God I have loſt my ſoul: I can never find it in Chriſt; 'tis ſometime in wealth, in husband, and ſometime in children, in houſes and in lands, but never in Heaven; when it ſetteth about this 'tis tired preſently.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:113418:50"/>
As the body ſo the ſoul goeth downward with eaſe, but up hill with much pains-taking; you muſt be full of complaints to Chriſt to keep your ſouls in his boſome.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Finally, as idleneſſe ſo wilfulneſſe deſtroyes divine contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. Pride puffeth up, and ſwelld ſouls go more to hell then to Heaven, like-ſpirits boſome. The heart ſwelld, thoughts are all preſt and taken up to make vent for this, that there is ſcarce a thought to be ſpared to aſcend to Chriſt. When the heart is high and haughty, Chriſt and Truth are under foot; and thoughts never boſome themſelves in that which the heart tramples upon. Every thing that croſſeth will vex a wilfull man though it be truth; and vexation and contemplation are as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite as Saul and David, as Heaven and hell. I look upon ſome men and they are puft up; will leads them and not truth: I ſmite my breaſt and ſay, Ah Lord! where do theſe ſouls dwell? In hell certainly, and not in Heaven. Errour is the fruit of pride; the ſoul goeth away from God and boſomes it ſelf in a lie, as it groweth heady and high minded. Citizens look about you, I ſee an ignorant idle proud ſpirit amongſt you; Chriſt may be much in ſuch mens tongues, but ſurely he is but little in their hearts. The excellency of Chriſt you do not indeed dwell upon, nor find ſweetneſſe in, nor cannot as long as theſe evils are in your hearts.</p>
               <p>Let us all know our dutie and do it all, Chriſt is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; ſo did David, ſo did Paul, and ſo muſt we conſider him. <hi>I will meditate of all thy works and talk of all thy doings,</hi> Pſal. 77. what Chriſt hath done as a Redeemer, and what as a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour; what he hath done with his finger, what with his hand, what with his ſpirit, and what with his bloud, we muſt medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate <hi>on all his works.</hi> Divine things are ſtill unfruitfull as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought of; when we ſeek after Chriſt, then he brings us into his chambers; the efficacy of all that Chriſt is, cometh in by contemplation. Every thing in Chriſt is uſefull, the very leaves of the tree of Life are healing: conſider Chriſt under any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in which the Scripture holds him forth as a Redeemer, or but as a Creatour, as the image of God, as the firſt-born, and the like, or under any other more remote conſideration, and they are all powerfull to take off the heart from earth and ſend it to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:113418:50"/>
Heaven. Chriſts action and Chriſts perſon, yea and Chriſts garments; all he ſaid, and all he did, and all he wore, very virtuall and inſtructing.</p>
               <p>Know your duty and know your felicity: you have now but a few things to think upon, this world is bleeding and dying apace; he that giveth all being, me thinks every one ſhould now much think upon, when all creatures ceaſe to be ſo faſt. A mans tranquility is permanent when his thoughts dwell upon Chriſt; let friends, means, towns, kingdomes die, and yet his Heaven lives, becauſe his heart is lodged in one that can die no more, that <hi>ever lives.</hi> Miſery is double, becauſe loſſe of the creature doth not reduce thoughts to Chriſt: the end of affliction not accompliſhed, you will be afflicted ſeven times more, till your prodigall ſouls return home to their father, and leave feeding on husks.</p>

The order of divine action is admirable; the beauty of God in his out-goings is held out to us. Chriſt is
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:113418:51"/>
the wiſdome of the Father; all that God doth he doth in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. <hi>The Lord by wiſdome hath founded the earth, and by underſtanding hath eſtabliſhed the heavens,</hi> Prov. 3.19. a like place to this you have Jeremy 10.12. <hi>He hath made the earth by his power, he hath eſtabliſhed the world by his wiſdome, and hath ſtretched out the heavens by his diſcretion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divine action is made with delight: you have many prime agents, but God hath but one; you look more at abilitie to your work, then ſuitableneſſe to your ſpirits in the agents you imploy, but God doth not: you can beare diſcontent in the agent, ſo his work be well done, but God cannot: he ſo moveth as to have delight in both, not onely in the work done, but in the agent that doth it, and therefore doth all in Chriſt. <hi>I was daily his delight, rejoycing alwayes before him,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, ſpeaking of God when in the creation of all things, Prov. 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Succeſſe.</note>The comfort of the godly is in this point: all divine action going forth in Chriſt, we may conclude ſucceſſe; ſucceſſefulneſſe to their good. Chriſt is mighty in ſtrength and wiſdome, our agents are unſucceſſefull for want of power, and for want of wiſdome; but the agent in and by whom God acts, is mighty in both. <hi>God is mighty in strength and wiſdome, he preſerveth not the life of the wicked, but giveth right to the poore,</hi> Job 36.5. Where great humane power is (it is Elihu his ſpeech to Job) men think to evade the bent and force of divine action, and to ſhun what God intends, as they ſhun what man intends, to get out of his reach as out of ours; but no ſuch matter, for all his action ſhall acquire his intention, and no man ſhall evade it; for he works in him who is mighty <hi>in ſtrength and wiſdome.</hi> God intended a world, did he miſſe the accompliſhment of it? God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſouls, you look much in and by whom the king acts, ſuch and ſuch skilfull men, and mighty men, and ſhake and fear; but look in and by whom God acts, and comfort your ſelves.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Full ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</note>All divine action going forth in Chriſt, we may conclude full ſucceſſe, that is, in the thing, and in the circumſtance of time: Chriſt doth ſo much as God intends, and in ſuch a time; in ſo many dayes he was to make the world, and he did it to a <hi>pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi> of time, and reſted with his Father: and in ſo many years

Time is in Chriſts hand as well as the work of time: the Father hath put all into his hand, <hi>my times are in thy hand.</hi> The great world may ſay to Chriſt, My times was in thy hand, in ſo many dayes didſt thou bring me forth, and ſo many years wilt thou uphold me. And the new world may ſay, My time is in thy hand, in ſo many years thou wilt bring me forth. You murmure that things go no faſter on, the time of the new world is in Chriſts hand, and it ſhould be reſt enough to a ſaint in all troubles, to look up and conſider in whoſe hands worlds are tranſacted. God moveth in one that anſwers his will exact, that obſerveth his work and his time. <hi>Lo I come, as it is [written] in the volume of thy book.</hi> Search how it is written concerning Chriſts creating this new world, and you ſhall ſee that he will come and do it exactly. Lo I come, as it is <hi>written,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, but not as impatient ſpirits expect: inſtruments muſt be blamed when they take not their time, (I mean inſtruments which we imploy for our good in this time of diſtreſſe) but the heart muſt be quieted in this, that Gods agent exactly keeps his time,</p>
               <p>This is not all your conſolation: you may argue for the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt mercies upon this ground, that God is your Creatour in Chriſt, <hi>Thy hands have made me and faſhioned me give me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding that I may live,</hi> Pſal. 119.73. from ſuch power you may argue to ſuch love; from great power you may argue for great love: Thou didſt <hi>create me</hi> in Chriſt according to ſuch a noble being, do thou <hi>new create</hi> me in Chriſt, for the reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this being, as if the Pſalmiſt had ſo ſaid: this I think may be his meaning, and the ſtrength of his argument. Many of you are weary of your being, you do ſo ſinne, but you might have more comfort in your being, if you did look up and conſider who gave it, and what obligement lies upon him by it; he gave your being in Chriſt, and he will reſtore this being in Chriſt, if you plead it to him as David. <hi>Thine hands have made me and faſhioned me; give me underſtanding that I may live.</hi> Thus do thou ſay to God. A child of God may argue love and compaſsion from any thing that Gods hand doth to him, upon

Reade Proverbs 8.31.32. After that Chriſt is there mentioned in ſtate as the Creatour of all, this he inferreth upon it: <hi>viz. Now therefore hearken unto me O ye children,</hi> that is, children by creation; for <hi>bleſſed are they that keep my wayes. Heare instruction and be wiſe and refuſe it not. He that ſinneth againſt me, wrongeth his own ſoul.</hi> So he concludeth, as Chriſt is complete to attract love, the ſame will be his ſufficiency and advantage to aggravate our ſliding off him: for thus Chriſt will ſay to ſinners at the great day, I am a firſt-born, I am the Image of the Father, I am a Redeemer, I am a Creatour, and yet though all theſe thou regardeſt me not; all excellencies ſleighted ſhall be turned into ſo many rods to laſh your dead ſouls. The ſins you love will deſtroy your being, and your being, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, you will fall into your Creatours hand again, and what being do you think he will give you then. God dealeth with you as you are; you are naturall, and he fetcheth argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you from nature, as what is more naturall to you then your being: the lower God ſtoupes to ſtirre you and you yet unmoved, the more obſtinate you are; you are no new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, therefore God argueth with you ſimply as creatures, and then you ſhew your ſelves blocks: you uſe no art about a block but to burn it, and ſo doth God when ſinners become ſots and blocks and underſtand not ſo much as the principall of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall being, though opened and urged upon them by a God: blockiſh ſouls think on this, you will have a very hot ſermon to warm you when you come to your place.</p>

Heaven hath ſome community in it; there dwelleth Eaſt-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Weſt-country, North-country, South-country men, but then they are all one ſpirit; no walk above in which there is hearing, ſeeing, taſting or ſmelling, any contrary thing: though there be many millions more above then are here; as having been the receptacle of all travellers from hence for this many thouſand years, beſides the natives of the place, and yet not two ſpirits amongſt all theſe innumerable numbers that diſagree, or will in the ſpace of eternity. But here one cannot walk any where, but one contradicting and afflicting thing or other meets a man: here I ſee a Toad, there I feel a Serpent; here I heare a Lion, there I ſmell a Fox; and yet all theſe claim a dwelling juſt where I do, <hi>in earth.</hi> This is the ſecond thing: earth ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a common room.</p>

We are here a great wide Common full of moles and mole-hills, all heaving and heaping up earth, but blind and do not ſee what we do. <hi>Bring forth the blind that have eyes, and the deaf which have eares,</hi> ſaith God.

O how damnably do many love their dwelling in earth! When the body dwelleth in earth and the ſoul too, Ah Lord! that is damnable dwelling in earth indeed. Though God hath placed your bodies in earth, yet he looketh that you ſhould place your ſouls in Heaven; but ſhew me a man that thus doth. God made your bodies earthy, but you make your ſouls earthy your ſelves, and you will anſwer for it. I wonder what you find in earth, that you ſhould make your ſouls dwell here. Do you not find it a low common dark unclean room? And yet muſt your ſouls dwell here becauſe your bodies do? then you will periſh as beaſts, worſe.</p>
               <p>I might go along this way and do well, but I muſt turn ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way and tell you, that you have a baſe dwelling here, and therefore expect things anſwerable. Chriſtians have no art to quiet their ſouls when things go hard: you may gather patience from the very place you dwell in; you live in a baſe place, and what can you expect but baſe uſage? When your dwelling is
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:113418:54"/>
removed from earth to Heaven, things will be better preſently, as well as you would wiſh. You dwell in earth, and in earth dwelleth all ſorts, and every one will act according to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and how can it be helpt here? Some are back-biters, and they will kill your name: ſome are ſycophants, and they will kiſſe you and hug you to death like Judas; ſome are hypocrites, wolves in ſheeps cloathing, and they will not onely kill your bodies, but your ſouls too. The earth yields variety of deadly vermine, and you cannot tread upon all, ſome will tread upon you, ſome will crawl about you and ſting you, do what you can. Diſtreſſe ſhould make mortification, but not vexation; ſo it did with David, it tooke him off from all in earth but one, <hi>whom have I in earth but thee?</hi> Diſtreſſe ſhould not diſturb but ſubdue the heart, and yet 'tis hard to keep the ſpirit quiet when baſely uſed, tell it what one will, Fallen creatures are full of paſſion, and ſtrong paſſion can bear nothing, and yet muſt bear it ſelf, which is the heavieſt burden of all. All things in earth do like themſelves, and therefore turn aſide my ſoul from them: whom have I in earth in compariſon of thee, O Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is one good in earth, and thats all I know: get ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him, yea that would find comfort in your dwelling here. Bleſſed be one good neighbour, or how ſolitary ſhould we be in earth. <hi>Defile not the land which ye ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite [wherein I dwell]</hi> ſaith Chriſt, Numb. 35.34. The earth would be hell did not Chriſt dwell in it: you have much miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kept off by one good neighbour you have, and you might have more if you did but get more acquaintance with him. You have lived a great while in the earth, and ſo hath Chriſt: do ye know him? do ye love him? he maketh the earth a bleſſing as baſe as 'tis, to ſuch. A mans felicity dependeth altogether upon the favour of God. let his dwelling be where 'twill. Earth is heaven, hell is heaven when God dwelleth with one there. Mourning creatures tell me, where do ye dwell? In a vally of tears? In earth doth Chriſt dwell with you? doth he dwell in earth too, in your hearts? then be cheared for he will wipe all tears from your eyes: and if your hearts be a reſt for him, he will be a reſt for them, when you have none in earth. When the earth trembles and melts, you have one that dwelleth in it
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:113418:54"/>
that will ſee you ſhall do well. Chriſtians viſit your next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour often, lie in his boſome whileſt you live on earth, you will live very deſolate elſe were the earth a better place then 'tis.</p>
               <p>I pitty all that live in this world 'tis ſo baſe and miſerable, but them that live without God in this world, my heart bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth over them. Some live where they have no good neighbour, nor no friend, and they truly have a bad life on it; ſome live ſo in earth, that it were as good they were in hell almoſt; whipt in body, tortured in ſoul, longing for death and yet it muſt not be, becauſe not yet full ripe for hell, Ah Lord! here is a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in earth indeed: what difference now between earth and hell? All you that live in earth and live in your ſinnes, expect ſuch a life every houre. The earth groneth, it beareth ſo many and ſo naught: ſinners do not you grone too? Do not you grone to Chriſt to be better? The earth will be eaſed of her bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den quickly, but not you; your place will be changed quickly, but not for the better; all that are now in earth will be anon in hell, that do not leave their ſinnes quickly; the ſword and ſtrange diſeaſes are going about for this purpoſe, and do you not ſee how they ſweep the earth?</p>

               <p>The ſoul is manifold in its acts and operations, and ſo is Chriſt that all the ſoul may follow him. <hi>There is a manifold grace of God</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh; a grace <hi>viſible,</hi> and a grace <hi>inviſible,</hi> and the ſoul can make at both, and ſo Chriſt would have it. The eye can ſee, the eare can heare, the heart can conceive; here is working without and within. Conception is operation about <hi>inviſibilia</hi> unſeen, things; 'tis a ſpirit at work upon words, ſhaping out to it ſelf what they but mentioned, as countries and creatures where the body never was nor never ſaw, but onely ſhall; divine conception 'tis a ſpirit taking ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it were in the word, and ſayling round the world, taking
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:113418:55"/>
in viſible and inviſible things, to leave out none of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſoul is noble in its acts, and Chriſt would loſe none for want of imployment: if <hi>viſible</hi> things be to low to be buſied about there be <hi>inviſible:</hi> if there be nothing without doore to be found for imployment, to wit in earth, it may find ſomething within about inviſible things, by going to Heaven. Creation is laid by Chriſt with gradation higher and higher, viſible and inviſible; if one room be too low the ſoul may go higher, as high as it will, as high as it hath power; the works of Chriſt lie as high as the talleſt ſpirit can reach. The ſoul is not forc'd but drawn to noble action; Creation is temptation, the works of God are laid ſo as to entice the ſoul higher and higher, like Jacobs ladder, till it come as high as it ſhould be. When the eye of the body is weary of looking upon bruits, trees and ſuch like viſible things as are here, then the eyes of the ſoul may go one room higher in the ladder towards Heaven, to things which are not ſeen, to that inviſible place and ſocietie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The ſoul is remiſs'd in his acts, in works as well as in words; Chriſt leaveth this without excuſe. Man was never without full imployment, Adam had it, and the ſonnes of Adam have it. There is a double book of words, and a double book of works to reade, and one higher then the other; one viſible, and the other inviſible; one for the eyes of the body, another for the eyes of the ſoul; and I wonder what idle ſouls will ſay for themſelves when Chriſt cometh to reckon with them. You have a talent and imployment for it; a ſoul, ſuch a noble ſoul, and ſuch noble imployment; both neglected will lie hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie upon you, Bodily ſloth you cannot bear, and ſoul-ſloth Chriſt cannot bear: ſoul-ſloth is enraging ſinne, and obſerve how angrily Chriſt chargeth it. <hi>Thou wicked and ſlothfull ſervant] ſhouldst thou not have imployed what I gave thee to my advantage,</hi> Matth. 25.26. take from him what he hath ſaith Chriſt, A man hath his ſoul taken away, that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not: an idle ſoul becometh a beſotted ſoul, a beſotted ſoul is no ſoul; a ſpirit dead and buried in the fleſh: powers and parts are blaſted and withered when neglected.</p>
               <p>Soul-idleneſſe about divine things, ſpringeth ſometimes from
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:113418:55"/>
too much imployment about humane, and ſuch men neither know their hearts, nor yet this time: worldly now, and you will be worldly when the world cometh to be burnt. The ſoul is firſt let looſe from divine things, and then when 'tis abroad, it will not be lured in again by them, though held up to them. Wicked worldlings, you know not what you do when you let your ſouls looſe to the world; there 'tis curſt and becometh wild, and will not return though words of God and works of God, all that God is and doth be held up to it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the prodigall ſaid to be <hi>loſt,</hi> for this my ſonne <hi>was lost,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sometimes ſoul-idleneſſe about divine things ſpringeth from diſlike of them. Some, the God of this world <hi>blindeth them,</hi> and 'tis idle to talk to theſe of viſible or inviſible things, for all that is good is inviſible to them; they know not how to ſet their ſpirits about any thing, but to make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill the luſts of it. Ah Lord, how blind, how baſe are ſome ſouls! No word of God, no work of God viſible to them, under a divine notion. Idleneſſe maketh profaneneſſe, profaneneſſe putteth all powers under the black rod, to wit, the devill: A ſoul under the power of Satan and the world, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imploy it ſelf well. Poore bond-ſlaves, ſeek your freedome by Chriſt, or you will be condemned.</p>
               <p>You whoſe ſoul-powers are under no power but Chriſts, from you is this expected, that you make full imployment to your ſelves about the various works of God, that you travell this world over, and the next above it as farre as you can, into viſible and inviſible things, and if you looſe your ſouls this way, you will find them in Heaven: the ſoul getteth his perfection by much travell. Bees fill not their hives from one flower, nor in one journey, they are fain to go farre and near, from garden to garden, from field to field, from flower to flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: ſo muſt we from viſible to inviſible things, to fill our ſouls with the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt.</p>

               <p>INviſible things are here named by viſible for our ſakes; thrones, dominions, principalities and powers, are all terms uſed amongſt us, and we know what they mean, ſome chief in place and office, ſuperiority and rule over others; and ſo have Angels over this lower world, at the appointment and pleaſure of Chriſt, therefore called <hi>chief Princes</hi> in Daniel. <hi>The Prince of the kingdome of Perſia, withstood me one and twenty dayes, but loe Michael one of the [chief Princes] came to help me,</hi> Daniel 10.13.

               <p>Tearms are here multiplied ſynonymically, which when they are ſo, 'tis for our weakneſſe, there being no tearm comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive enough below, to expreſſe, things above, Angels being ſo tranſcendent in all eminences both of nature and office. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication like to this you ſhall find in the firſt to the Epheſians, 21. <hi>Farre above all principalities, powers, might, dominion,</hi> &amp;c. There is variety of offices amongſt the Angels, as appeareth by that place forecited in Daniel, but this is not pointed at here in my text (as I think) by the variety of tearms which are uſed, becauſe they are all of the ſame ſignification according to the letters, and point joyntly at one main thing, which Chriſt would have all his know. That the worlds are ſubordinate, that the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible world is under the dominion of the inviſible world, that Chriſt hath an unexpreſſable power and ſtrength by him at command, to over-rule this world and all things in it, <hi>thrones, dominions,</hi> &amp;c. that is, tranſcendent powers, which all the powers in this world call them what you will, will not fully expreſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:113418:56"/>I will demonſtrate this truth unto you by ſome angelicall properties. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Angels are unexpreſſeable for number: the viſible world is populous, but the inviſible world much more populous; they live not one upon another as we do, which makes great conſumption here, and yet live near together, much nearer then we can do, who are corporeall beings. <hi>The chariots of God are twenty thouſand, even thouſands, or many thouſands of Angels.</hi> His meaning is, that God hath more for number then any ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall can muſter up here, if he ſhould muſter up all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the world. You begin to number here from tennes and twenties, they do not begin to number above ſo low; thouſands and twentie thouſands, are Gods units, there he doth but begin to number. If men will go to numbring, God will out-number them, for his number is <hi>innumerable. Ye are come to an innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels,</hi> Hebr. 12.22. Our Saviours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion doth plainly demonſtrate it, that the inviſible world is very populous, and that God hath a mighty vaſt command thereof; ſouldiery to ſtill tumults here with eaſe, or to do what elſe ſervice he will. When one of Chriſts company pull'd out his ſword to fight for him, Put it up, ſaid Chriſt, think'ſt not that I can now pray to my Father, and he ſhall <hi>preſently give me more then twelve Legions of Angels?</hi> and every Legion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Romanes, was ſix thouſand; twelve ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and more. His meaning is innumerable numbers, and all theſe raiſed <hi>preſently,</hi> at a word ſighed out. Certainly they are very populous above. You are here along while of raiſing an army of tenne thouſand, and when you have done it, 'tis longer ere you can raiſe ſuch another; and when you have done it you cannot ſpare ſo many to wait up one perſon, about this poore creature, and that poore creature; and yet this is an ordinary thing with God. When Jacob went from Laban, Angels met him innumerable, and he admires it. <hi>This is Gods hoſt,</hi> ſaith he, and calls it <hi>Mahanaim,</hi> that is, two hoſts, or two camps. Gods hoſt, one is as bigge as two of ours, ten of ours, and yet theſe imployed every where, about this, and that Saint of God. Certainly the inviſible world is unſpeakable populous: Angels are unexpreſſeable for number.</p>

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:113418:57"/>
is death to us. A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the <hi>countenance of an Angel of God, very terrible,</hi> ſaid Manoahs wife to him, Judg. 13.6. it was ſo terrible that it would have killed her and her husband too, if God had not mightily upheld, they are ſo fearfully made to fleſh and bloud. <hi>He hath made his Angels ſpirits, and his miniſters a flame of fire.</hi> What is more terrible then a flame of fire? it conjures na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſpirits, and makes them all croud in upon the heart, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to croud the heart to death. 'Twas the preſence of an Angel that rendred the buſh as a flame of fire to Moſes; it was a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Angels, which rendred mount Sinai a burning mount, which was a terrible ſight; ſo terrible was the ſight, that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſaid, <hi>I exceedingly fear and quake,</hi> Hebr. 12. Fire is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme element for dread; its an element that ſits nearer God then all others do, and goes forth with more of his majeſty when it deſcends. Angels have the advantage of a perfect image; this advantage when it was upon man, rendred him very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to all the creation. They have not defiled their ſcarlet robes; as God did put them on at firſt, ſo they wear them ſtill, which render them full of majeſty. Man hath but a little of God in him, and with him now, and yet this holds him up, and holds him out, as a creature of much ſtate; but Angels have much of God in them and with them, he never ſends out theſe embaſſadours, but he ſends the very crown-jewels with them, Chriſt goeth perſonally among them. Three Angels came to Abraham, and one of them is Chriſt, as you ſhall plainly ſee, if you examine the 18. and 19. of Geneſis together. And ſo the Pſalmiſt ſaith, the chariots of the Lord are ſo many thouſands, <hi>and the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.</hi> Kings, they have ſome that wait onely upon their perſon, and chariots onely for their perſon. Angels they wait onely upon Chriſts perſon, where they go, one may ſay as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>the Lord is among them,</hi> though men cannot alwayes alike ſee it; and this I think was the reaſon, that Moſes was called to put off his ſhoes, when the Angel appeared in the buſh, becauſe Chriſt was perſonally preſent there, among thoſe miniſtring ſpirits that were there, to ſignifie good to that people.</p>

they affright all, but themſelves are affrighted with nothing, neither with men nor with devils; they will ſet upon either. There is an expreſſion, Matth. 13. towards the latter end, which demonſtrates the ſtrength and courage of Angels admirably. They are Chriſts <hi>reapers of the great field of this world.</hi> The enemy that <hi>ſowed tares is the devil; the tares are the children of the wicked, the harvest the end of the world, and the reapers the Angels.</hi> The Angels are they that will make an end of the world, that will cut down tares &amp; the ſowers of them, &amp; make no more of one then of the other: they are ſuch creatures as ſhall cleanſe the world, and then burn the world; glean the world of all the godly, and then burn the reſt: they can lay ſuch a train, that ſhall blow up the world: they are thoſe flames of fire, that will ſet a fire, &amp; burn all the world at the great day: they can take up this world, as bigge as 'tis, and throw it all into hell, and hold it there to all eternity. They ſhall be inſtrumentall about the greateſt deſigne the Scripture ſpeaks of. <hi>The ſonne of man ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they ſhall gather out of his kingdome all that offend, and ſhall caſt them into a furnace of fire.</hi> I judge, that good Angels are the inflicters of plagues upon the bad, and that it is they that make hell to curſed ſpirits, one ſparkle of which, is bigger then that flame which ſhall burn the world; and judge you then of what courage and ſtrength they are, that can take all the wicked men in the world, and all the wicked ſpirits in hell at once by the throat, and make them all roar to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to eternity. All runnes into this, <hi>that Christ hath an unexpreſſeable power and ſtrength with him at command, to over-rule the viſible world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us bewail the blindneſſe of the viſible world. Would the great men of the world did know how great Chriſt is. Thoughts advance themſelves upon no ground, pride will be the ruin of thouſands, a little fleſhly dying ſtrength, makes men dare hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; this folly will ſink men to hell. This world is overmatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed infinitely, and yet proud in its attempts; 'tis beſet with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible force, and yet ſees nothing, nor does nothing, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell againſt all the hoſt of heaven, and the Lord of theſe hoſtes; what ſtrength Chriſt hath, he will put forth againſt this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Wicked men, fear Chriſt: he will eat you out like a
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:113418:58"/>
moth elſe, an inviſible power will carry the day againſt you. You can onely look upon fleſhly ſtrength, and you ſee we have but little of this now, ſo God in his wiſdome hath ordered things againſt us, and this makes you bold in your attempts: but trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for verily Chriſt hath a ſtratagem upon you; when you are confident, becauſe you ſee little power on earth, you ſhall be cut off <hi>without hand,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks, with an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible force. This is Babylons proper judgement, <hi>Thou haſt truſted in thy wickedneſſe, thou haſt ſaid in thy heart, I am, and none elſe beſides me, therefore ſhall evill come upon thee, and thou ſhalt not know whence it ariſeth, and miſcheif ſhall fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and thou ſhalt not be able to put it off; and deſolation ſhall come upon thee ſuddenly, which thou ſhalt not know,</hi> Eſa. 47.11. Wicked wretches, glory not whatever your ſtrength be. Chriſt hath an ambuſcadoe for you, an inviſible army which will conſume you ſtrangely.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I have two things to you Chriſtians from this point: truſt in Chriſt, and admire him. <hi>Truſt in the Lord, for with him is everlaſting strength:</hi> Angels never die, no work nor no wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kills them, or tires them. You will be ſure, Chriſtians, of one complete army to lie out for you all this winter, which will coſt you no money, nor need no recrute; an army of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does which have been in all the fights, that have been in the world ſince the creation, and under ſuch a generall to get skill, as is not in the world. No men more fearfull then the godly uſually: I wonder at it, you have a wall of fire about you, which is better then your wall of earth. <hi>His miniſters are a flame of fire,</hi> and his miniſters are your miniſters, and encompaſſe you. The Angels of the Lord encamp about them that fear him. Fear ſprings from unbelief, and unbelief from unſeen means, and this is living by ſence, which if our Father Abraham had ſo li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his journey to the mount Moriah, and in his journey to Canaan, he had broke his heart,: God hath in this, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things ſhadowed out to Chriſtians, how all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Church of Chriſt, ſhall be carried in unſeen wayes, and by unſeen powers, and therefore commanded living by faith, and not by ſight, and yet every man pleads for a life of ſence. God works in a way of means, ſay they, which is true,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:113418:58"/>
but theſe means not alwayes viſible: As you get by ſuch a life, ſo continue your argument for it. Paſſion is better confuted by the hand of God. then by the word of God. Unbelief is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed with ſtanding puniſhment. Lots wife is turned into a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of ſalt, and ſalt is a very tormenting and yet a very laſting thing.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Admire Chriſt, for he maketh it manifeſt that he hath an unexpreſſable power at command, to over-rule the viſible world: he letteth battells go againſt us for many houres together, and cutteth off our arm of fleſh, and then turneth the day himſelf by wounded men in an inſtant, no man knoweth how: certainly he hath a great command by him, which neither enemy nor we are aware of. My heart bleedeth to behold how blind we are in talking of men; but my heart is more ſad to heare how our adverſaries curſe and take on; they ſay that our Generall deals with the devill, or he could not turn about the day ſo againſt diſadvantage. Poore ſouls, ſome body hurteth them and they cannot ſee whom; Chriſts army is inviſible. The devil is true enough to his cauſe, they need not have ſuch hard thoughts of him, he is not falſe to his own kingdome as they are; Chriſts hoſts certainly fight againſt them, but when will they ſee and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe this? their blindneſſe and ſtubbornneſſe will break all their backs, which is ſad, but what muſt to the ſword, let it to the ſword. Let us admire juſtice upon our adverſaries, and mercy upon ourſelves, let us all ſhout and ſay, Chriſts army is a brave army; Chriſts army is very great. <hi>Thou haſt broken Rahab in pieces as one that is ſlain; thou haſt ſcattered thine enemies with thy ſtrong arm,</hi> Pſalm 89.10. by Rahab is meant Egypt the generation which now are ſlain; and the holy Ghoſt goeth on and telleth us how we ſhould attribute victory to the glory of the inviſible power, and not to any fleſhly arm; <hi>Thou haſt broken Rahab,</hi> &amp;c. A like Scripture you have; Hoſea, 1.7. <hi>But I will have mercy upon the houſe of Judah; and will ſave them by the Lord their God, and will not ſave them by bow nor by ſword, nor by battell, nor by horſes, nor by horſemen.</hi> Therefore let us lift up our hearts and tongues now, and ſay to Chriſt, that we are <hi>ſaved by the Lord our God,</hi> and by his inviſible hoſt, and not by men.</p>

                  </label> Things may be diſtinguiſhed in their kind, but not in their laſt ends: <hi>There is one kind of fleſh of men, another of fiſh, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of beaſts,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: and things may be diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their place, as ſome high, and ſome low; and things may be diſtinguiſhed by their parts, as ſome learned, and ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned: but none muſt be diſtinguiſhed in their end; all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, all places, all parts muſt be for Chriſt. The Law is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall, nothing is abſolutely given, but all the creation is put out to uſe for him; ten talents, five talents, one talent, not one thing in the world for mans uſe, but muſt be for Chriſts; not one thing in the world made for man, but muſt be by man made for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Chriſt in a few dayes made man work for all his dayes; things are not to be for Chriſt to day, and againſt him to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but for him for ever. <hi>His praiſe endureth for ever.</hi> In good times, in bad times, all things muſt be for him, as long as they are, Chriſts glory muſt be everlaſting, as ours ſhall be when he cometh to order all the creation for us. Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions muſt have their extent. Men miſunderſtand this phraſe in the Text that think Chriſt muſt have all things for him, when all advantages ſerve. All things muſt be for Chriſt in all times, till times ſhall be no more, and then all things are to be for us.</p>
               <p>Man hath a great deal of work upon him, and conſidereth it
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:113418:59"/>
not, he is to take every thing by the hand, and lead it home; every thing on earth that he medleth with, and lead it home to Heaven: husband, wife, children, goods, meat, drink, by him, and through him. and <hi>to him are all things.</hi> Some things are further from God then others, and yet all I meddle with I muſt up with, in one notion or other, and away with it <hi>to him.</hi> There is but one carrier to Heaven in all the earth, and that is man, and he is loaded with a witneſſe; he muſt carry all that is by God and through him, <hi>to him;</hi> and this he muſt do though he ſigh, and grone till his back break and he die, and then he will have a porters pay. You have ſome carriers for letters, and then you have creatures of a lower rank to carry other things; but Chriſt hath but one carrier for all; man muſt carry his words, his works, his letters and all elſe here below to him.</p>
               <p>Divinity is high in its ſcope: the glory of Chriſt is the higheſt thing, and nothing maketh at it but man, but he muſt make at nothing elſe. Man is not to ask what things are made of, but what things are made for; the former belongeth to Chriſt, and the latter to us. 'Tis an earthen world this, but mans work is to make it heavenly; 'tis an earthen boul but wants a by as to run right, and man is to put in one to make it incline Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and to run true to God that made it.</p>
               <p>Low things have a high ſcope, and yet as high as 'tis, man muſt make at it upon pain of death: we may uſe any thing but take the glory of nothing: if an Herod, a King feed on this diſh, he dieth for it. Benjamin muſt have a diſh of dainties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, what fit may be given to inſtruments, but divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this is Chriſts diſh, he alone muſt feed on theſe dainties; if any taſte of this hony, though but with the tip of his ſtaff, he dieth for it, and worms the meaneſt creatures, ſhall be ſtrong enough to do it.</p>
               <p>Some points will bear diſpute, but this will bear none, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I am to give glory to Chriſt yea or no in all. God hath ſet a King in Sion, and 'tis ſinne to ſay, <hi>may I crown him?</hi> I muſt crown him with glory, though I take off mine own crown to do it. <hi>The foure and twenty elders fell down before him that ſat on the throne, and worſhipt him that liveth for ever &amp; ever,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:113418:60"/>
and cast their crowns before the throne, ſaying, thou art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie O Lord to receive glory, honour, and power, for thou haſt created all things, and for thy pleaſure they are, and were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> Rev. 4.10, 11. There is no place for the diſpute of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum</hi> in this point with Chriſt, for all is his: <hi>all mine are thine:</hi> as he ſaid to his Father, ſo we are to ſay to him, all ours are his; the very crowns we wear, the things we have that render us moſt glorious in the eye of men, muſt be for Chriſt: all our crowns muſt go to his crown.</p>
               <p>Many will die by this law, for every man ſeeks his own. I and mine muſt live, and ſo muſt Chriſt and his. Skinne is dear, all muſt go for this, but nothing for Chriſt; which is the life of a beaſt, and not of a Chriſtian. This time diſcovers thouſands, nothing muſt be for Chriſt, becauſe times call for all for him. Neutrality is condemned by this point; ſome will be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for, nor againſt Chriſt, which cannot be; all muſt be for him. Conceits are ſtrange, where the heart is naught: can a man onely be a looker on in matters of God, which concern his glory, and our eternall welfare? Fleſh is fearfull, and where this predominates, all the care is to look to one, and that one is ſelf, and not Chriſt, which will be the ſhame of that one unto all forever. O how dear is name, and ſtate, wife, and children now! But how dear is Chriſt? Men of the world, look into your hearts now, if ever you would know them throughly: would you not fain ſtand Neuters now in our cauſe, to give your purſe ſome reſt? Is not the pulling of your purſe-ſtrings, as the pulling of your heart-ſtrings? Alas for me, what ſhall I and mine do? all will be gone, I ſhall be quite undone. What is Chriſt beleft, is all gone?</p>
               <p>Nothing will be for Chriſt, as it ſhould be, when the heart is not, I would you would all look to this, Give your ſelves to the Lord, and then you will give all that is yours. <hi>This they did, they gave their own ſelves to the Lord, and then to us, by the will of God.</hi> Make your hearts throughly for Chriſt, and you will make all other things with eaſe. Luſts unmortified, the heart is unruly; the heart unruly, will part with things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its own will, and not according to Chriſts. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly heart becomes froward; frowardneſſe knows none but its
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:113418:60"/>
own will. Who is David? and who is the ſonne of Jeſſe? that I ſhould take up what is mine and give to I know not who? Many things go for Chriſt a while, plate, horſe, money, men, and of a ſudden all is checked, and nothing ſhall be for him; the plague of this is at the heart, this was never for him; but yet men do not conſider this, but plead a thouſand things of this ſide, and that ſpeaks all more miſerable.</p>
               <p>Two things ſpeak the heart for Chriſt, the riſe and the ſcope of action: the heart is not for Chriſt, let the action be what it will, when it ſprings not from love. <hi>Peter loveſt thou me? Feed my lambs.</hi> Naked action, though never ſo good, ſpeaks not the heart for Chriſt, but the ſpring of that action. Do ye love Chriſts Lambs and feed them? I will tell you a ſad thing, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a ſouldier hath a hand for Chriſt, and a heart againſt him, and what a pittie is this. So many a Citizen hath a purſe a little open for Chriſt, and a ſpirit quite ſhut againſt him. Certainly our motion for Chriſt is heartleſſe motion: love oyls her own wheels. as long as ſhe hath any work, or any power, and we are quickly weary of well-doing.</p>
               <p>The ſpring of action, and the ſcope of action, ſpeaks the heart for God: not what you do, but at what you aim. <hi>He that ſeeketh his glory that ſent him, the ſame is true, and there is no unrighteouſneſſe in him,</hi> John 7.18. The generation is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually plagued, which is worſe then all the plagues which are upon us: men do little, and mean leſſe: ſcarce a true heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us. The body hath two eyes, but the ſoul ſhould have but one, looking onely at Chriſt; but ſhew me ſuch a man now. We are a kingdom of ſquint-eyed perſons; ſtates are broken, any way will ſerve to mend them: let whoſe will loſe, is there any way for me to gain? Trialls are quick, ſpirits per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; kingdomes reel, nothing to be had; you muſt comply and do as others do, and ſeek your ſelf, for you cannot rid it out: thus we reaſon. Simplicity is a rock, I ſee but few of theſe in our ſeas, Surely, ſurely, ſouls are drown'd apace in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, that is upon us. Men that did look bravely at Chriſt, now look baſely at themſelves, which ſpeaks more wounds to a wounded kingdome: the Lord heal ſuch hearts, or elſe when will this land be healed.</p>

                  </label> HEre is a term of connexion in the front of this verſe, which calls for ſomething to be ſpoken relatively. Circumſtances are multiplied, to winne reſpect to Chriſt. Much is ſaid before, and here is more, and yet all expreſſion too little to winne affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. The heart of man naturally is damnable cold. One or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament is enough to ſet a man dear in your breaſt, but all orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments not enough to ſet Chriſt dear. <hi>Affection naturally, is no whit divine.</hi> Chriſt is very honourable in gifts, and ſo in years, he is the ancient of dayes, <hi>He is before all things,</hi> and yet all nothing.</p>
               <p>Let us all bleed under the baſeneſſe of our affection ſo much ſhould not be ſaid to quicken, were we not all very dead. There muſt be ſome divine principall in the ſoul, ere any divine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall held up to it, will take it. if heaven were open to you, yet would you have no heart to go in, unleſſe your hearts be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too. Should Chriſt himſelf come from the dead, and ſtand in that glory before you, in which he ſtands now, at the right hand of God, yet unleſſe ſomething be done within, this ſight without, will not gain you to him; you will tremble, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat him to depart.</p>
               <p>Sinners, know the plague of your heart: Chriſt is not reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in you, and therefore all that here he ſaith to you, is no more ſtirring. You have glory after glory here, and yet nothing gains: you ſpit out the ſowerneſſe of your ſouls, in the face of him that is ſweet to you: I am afraid nothing is yet done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, and is this nothing to you? And if ſo, your ſtate is the more grievous to Chriſt. When we do not love Chriſt, we ſhould confeſſe it to him; a plague hid, Chriſt looks not after it, but lets it ramble and kill the ſoul.</p>
               <p>Yet muſt we Chriſts ſervants, ſtrive with you ſtill, and fight with dead men, as long as we are in this dying tabernacle; and all that Chriſt ſaith of himſelf, we muſt ſay to you, though you grow worſe and worſe: into every chamber of the king of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we muſt lead you, though it be of no taking glory to you. My text puts me now to ſpeak of the eternity of Chriſt to you, <hi>he is before all things,</hi> which is one of the higheſt things of
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:113418:61"/>
concernment in the world, to ſee what this will do. We muſt be ſweet to ſowre ſouls, though they grow more ſowre by it: we muſt put ſweets into filthy ſtomachs, though they cruddle in their ſtomachs, and ſpue them up again, in the face of him that preſcribed them.</p>

                  <hi>Eternitie is continuation without termination, quae nnllo tempore finitur,</hi> that is bounded with no time. Melchiſedeck is made a ſhadow of eternitie, he is ſaid to be <hi>without beginning of dayes and end of life.</hi> You may call eternity life, for 'tis an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiall attribute to the higheſt life: but then you cannot mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure this life by dayes and years, no not by beginning nor end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for 'tis without both ſaith the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of dayes or end of life: Eternitie is a life of and to it ſelf, without term or dependance, any denomination from any thing without it ſelf.</hi> You may denominate ſome things by ſome accidents that belong to them, as long, ſhort, great, little, but eternity is without all accident, and can be called by none of theſe, neither long nor ſhort, great nor little, but what it is eſſentially within it ſelf, a life without all term, a life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; a life from everlaſting to everlaſting: and ſuch a life did Chriſt live whileſt on earth, a life that had no term, that was before all things, and after all things.</p>
               <p>Eternall life is conſiſtent with humanity, though not with iniquity, with humane nature, though not with ſinfull nature. The God-head dwelt bodily with us, that is, in our nature dwelt that life which is eternall; that is, of and to it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any term, dependance or denomination, but from it ſelf. There is <hi>principium ordinis, &amp; principium temporis,</hi> a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of order, and this is competent to Chriſt as the Sonne of God: Firſt the Father, and then the Sonne.

<pb n="114" facs="tcp:113418:62"/>
eſſence and life, which is the ſame in all the three Perſons, ſo there is none: The Father is eternall, the Sonne eternall, and the holy Ghoſt eternall, without termination, or denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on known to us: <hi>The Sunne is appointed for times and ſeaſons, for dayes, and moneths, and years,</hi> Gen. 1. 'Tis a long met-yard to meaſure the Heavens which is wonderfull ſpacious, and it doth it ſpeedily; 'tis <hi>menſura motus,</hi> the meaſure of all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above and below; but there is no meaſure for eternity but it ſelf, but the Sonne of righteouſneſſe who fully comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his own being, in all the properties of it: it can be put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no definition in our terms, and ſo conſequently into no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conception, and therefore when ſpoken of 'tis very brok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly, and yet as may beſt reach to your apprehenſion, as calling it ſomething before the eldeſt thing you can think of. <hi>He is before all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As Chriſt is in being ſo in office, the one giveth fitneſſe to the other: <hi>He is a King eternall, a Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchiſedeck.</hi> Every being hath proper action; as Chriſt is he doth, he hath eternall life, and doth eternall actions; he bleſſeth for ever, curſeth for ever; he blotteth out ſinne for ever, and writeth down ſinne for ever; <hi>Now go write it before them in a table and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever, that this is a rebellious people, lying children, that will not heare the Law of the Lord.</hi> Eſay 30.8.9. <hi>If thou forſake him he will caſt thee off for ever,</hi> 1.

lifted and extolled: <hi>I will extoll thee O God my King.</hi> Chriſt is eternall in both, and in all other attributes, he is God-King, and God-Prieſt, and God-Prophet, that is, of ſuitable action in all theſe Offices to the nature of an eternall life, of a God-life (I may ſo ſpeak) and therefore ought joyntly ſtill to be conſidered and obſerved. Naughty hearts ſuſpend duty at pleaſure, they conſider not with whom they have to do; to day they will be holy, to morrow they will not, and in this undoe themſelves for ever, as falling under an eternall ſtroke. Beings and Offices over us muſt be acknowledged as they are; they are eternall, and muſt be obeyed eternally: <hi>Ever follow that which is good,</hi> Theſ. 5.15. Religion if it coſt you money, or if it coſt you bloud, yet you muſt obey, for he that liveth for ever, will otherwiſe make you die for ever. O England, take heed of eternall blows, if thou wave thy fidelity to Chriſt, to wave tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall ſtrokes, thou wilt have eternall ſtroakes, thou wilt be judged as Elies houſe for ever, and as the Churches in the Eaſt with a perpetuall deſolation, and <hi>Ziim and Ochim ſhall dance here, and thou ſhalt heare the voyce of the Turtle no more for ever,</hi> Eſay 13. Thy bending affrighteth me more then thy bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but I ſpare thee O weak England. Truth ſhould be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged according to its nature, and according to its Father; 'tis eternall, and ſo muſt we cleave to it; if thou canſt not receive this, the Lord have mercy upon thee England.</p>
               <p>I leave generalls and ſpeak to particulars: 'tis an eternall God ye have to do with, he is <hi>before all things,</hi> and will be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all things, wherefore tremble, and conſider your ſtate every one, what eternall things are done upon you. An eternall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, hath an eternall ſubject to work upon; your ſouls are everlaſting, and there Chriſt ſpecially worketh, as moſt ſuitable to him: little is to be heeded what is done without, in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of what is done within: you complain of many ſtrokes upon your ſtates, names, bodies, but is there not a ſtroke of ſtrokes, an eternall ſtroke upon your ſouls? <hi>Hence forth let fruit never be on thee more,</hi> Ah Lord! here is an eternall God, ſtriking a ſtroke like himſelf! Barren ſouls, is not this eternall ſtroke ſtrucken upon you? You of this congregation (let me waſh my hands of your bloud, ere my glaſſe amongſt you be

quite out) what hath my eternall maſter done in your eternall ſouls by the eternall words which he hath ſpoken by me, ſince the day I came amongſt you? Are not your hearts the ſame? as ſowre, as bitter, as cold, as carnall, as worldly as ever? Are not theſe ſymptomes of an eternall ſtroke, that God hath curſed you for your barrenneſſe under brave means, which you a long while have had, never to be otherwiſe then you are? Take time to give me an anſwer, till I come to this place again.</p>
               <p>Chriſt being eternall, eternall mercy may be had, if wanted by any people, and with more content to Chriſt then leſſer things: great perſons delight to give like themſelves. <hi>He asked life of thee, and thou gaveſt him long life, even life for ever more:</hi> As for naturall life, Chriſt maketh nothing of this gift. David thought that to beg naturall life had been a great requeſt, and no doubt but he would have accounted this much in ſome ſtraights but God maketh nothing of this, as being not to give like himſelf. An eternall God loveth to give eternally; <hi>The gift of God is eternall life.</hi> This is the priviledge of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them that ſeek him; they ask ſmall things, and he giveth great; they ask one thing, and he giveth them a better; they ask like themſelves, and he giveth like himſelf. Tender hearts are afraid to ask great things, but it ſhould not be, for 'tis moſt becoming him with whom we have to do, and you will ſooner get him to give audience about ſuch things, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout petty temporary things. Kings will not be moved in ſmall things, but in matters which beſeem their greatneſſe, to this they are ready. Our God is ready to give the leaſt good thing we need, to tender every hair, and every leaf, <hi>His leaf ſhall not wither;</hi> but he is moſt delighted to give the things that are moſt like him. When Jacob wreſtleth in a caſe of naturall life, the Angel would fain get gone: doubtleſſe his petition lay too low, for the Text ſaith, <hi>he was greatly afraid,</hi> and had there not been ſomething wrapt up in the buſineſſe, that had an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall reſpect, and which the Angel at this time did more look to then Jacob did, doubtleſſe Chriſt would have got away: he would not have been troubled with Jacob all night onely about the naturall life of him and his. Let weak ſouls remember the carriage of the King to Heſter, when ſhe cometh upon matters

of weight; the golden Scepter is held out, and ſhe toucheth it; <hi>What wilt thou Queen Heſter?</hi> It ſhadoweth out what Chriſt is to his Church, ready to give things of weight, ſuch a royall life and ſtate to his Church, as he hath himſelf, and to continue it againſt all Hamans.</p>

Of Chriſt as a creatour you have heard, and now as an upholder, you ſhall hear of him. In him all things are made of nothing, and in him all things abide, or elſe would turn all to nothing.

Bread is called a ſtaffe and ſupport, but this is but by Ordinance from Chriſt; for life comes not merely out of bread, it comes from Chriſt; life is not in bread, but in the word of bleſſing which comes out of the mouth of Chriſt.

No life hath its one property independant, we cannot live of our ſelves, nor we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not move, but in Chriſt, although we have life; life and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proper to it, is in him: this is true at the ſame height of the new man. We can do nothing of our ſelves, not think a good thought; thinking good and holy thoughts, this is the property of a holy ſpirit, and yet this its own property is dependant; 'tis not in a holy ſpirit, think holy thoughts, but 'tis in Chriſt. To live and to act the leaſt acts of life, is in the fountain of life. <hi>In him all things conſiſt,</hi> that is, beings, and actions.

the world; being and government, both are upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that is, being and diſpoſition of being. <hi>Who hath given him a charge over the earth, or who hath diſpoſed the whole world,</hi> Job. 34.13.</p>
               <p>Theſe things ſpeake the nature of providence what it is: 'tis a divine condeſcenſion to the neceſſity of the creature: Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an ark for every ſpecies, and for every individuall; power floating upon mercy, with the whole creation in its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Providence is power made out of mercy into food and raiment for the body, grace and glory for the ſouls.</p>
               <p>Providence is either common or ſpeciall.<note place="margin">Common providence.</note> Common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is the naked ſupportation of being, and but a little more at beſt. That the wicked in hell <hi>are,</hi> is providence, but it were better for them they were not, that their miſery did nihilate them, unleſſe their mercy were more. <hi>Common providence is an act of power, diſpenſing things commonly:</hi> the heavens give their wealth to all, and ſo do the earth and the ſea: the ſunne lights good and bad, all in and out of the world: <hi>God upholds all that fall.</hi> There is a generall compaſſion upon our fallen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by which it is upheld, and lies in the way of ſpeciall compaſſion. Some things Chriſt carries upon his back, others in his boſome: the one is common providence, and the other is ſpeciall. <hi>He upholds all things by the word of his power, he carries all things,</hi> ſaith the originall.</p>
               <p>Common providence laſts but for a time, God will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes be good to bad men. <hi>The triumphing of the wicked is ſhort,</hi> ſaith Jobs friends. They flouriſhed like a gree Bay-tree, but were ſuddenly gone, ſaith the Pſalmiſt of the wicked. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine dealings, ſhall be exactly ſuitable to condition: wicked men, as they have not a drop of grace, ſo they ſhall not have a drop of mercy to cool them, though now they have a great deal. Providence is very promiſcuous for a time, <hi>all comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to all;</hi> but 'twill be very proper, preciſe, and diſtinct in its way, divine dealing ſhall ſpeak the man, the hand of God ſhall plainly ſpeak out the heart of man; as the Lord will be known, ſo ſhall men be known, by the judgements which he executeth: this is a Cain, the brand of a vagabond is upon him, this is a Judas, the character of perdition is upon him: providence

Goats ſhall be known by their places, providence will be ſo exact. If the Bore cannot be known by his hair and his tusks, yet he ſhall be known by the knife that is in his throat, and his roring. Time ſhall be when this expreſſion, <hi>in him all things conſiſt,</hi> ſhall looſe its latitude; above half the world ſhall be ſhut out of the common providence of God utterly, and then will be the devils harveſt; O what a deal of buſineſſe will he have then, and how will hell enlarge it ſelf! when he ſhall have the ordering of all his own in the world, as he will!</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Speciall providence</note>
                  <hi>Speciall providence, is wiſdome ordering all things about man, to an eternall good:</hi> uſing the rod and the ſtaffe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; giving and taking away, clothing and ſtripping the body, to make the ſoul divine. Providence ſeems to be a heap of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, but it hath alwayes a proper ſcope, and all its acts, which to us are ſtrange, ſtill make very directly to it. There are two ſorts of veſſels in the world, and theſe are fitted to their proper end, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>one to honour,</hi> and the other <hi>to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi> not an act of God in the world, but it hath a fitting ſcope in it; not an act of God about a Chriſtian, but it hath a fitting ſcope to ſhape his ſoul for Abrahams boſome to fit in Chriſts arms for ever. A man is not to meaſure ſpeciall providence, by an externall ſucceſſe of action towards him as moſt do, but by an internall ſucceſſe: how doth poverty or riches, health or ſickneſſe, better the heart? Right-hand providence, is ſpeciall providence, <hi>Why with-draweſt thou thy hand, even thy right-hand, pull it out of thy boſome,</hi> Pſal. 74. When that hand or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all to me, upon which I ſhall ſtand for ever, and orders all ſo, as to bring me there, and ſet me there, this is ſpeciall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. David ſpeaks much of Gods right hand towards him: then is a right hand upon me, when all is ordered to bring my ſoul to its right end, and this is in Chriſt. <hi>In him all things conſist.</hi> In him grace is upheld, ordered, and brought to glory. Grace cannot live without Chriſt, glory cannot live without Chriſt. <hi>In him all things conſist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Speciall providence is perpetuall, but yet with reſpect to our
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:113418:66"/>
abiding in him with whom it is; <hi>in him all things conſiſt,</hi> and out of him Saints cannot conſiſt. <hi>If a man abide not in me, he is caſt forth as a branch and withers, which men gather and caſt into the fire,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. Chriſt carrieth as he is leaned upon; caſt burdens upon him as many as you will, and he will bear them all; lean not upon him, and he will let you fall, and all your burdens upon you. Chriſt cannot endure to have his children out of his boſome; if they keep in his arms he carrieth them for ever, and is never wearied with them: but let them go out of his arms, and he is tired with them preſently. Speciall providence worketh in order to faith, though it work not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply or faith: Chriſt doth all freely, but yet in his own way. <hi>Go teach all nations to obſerve whatſoever I have commanded you, and lo I am with you alwayes to the end of the world.</hi> In ſuch a way Chriſt walketh, walk out of that way and you will never meet him. This is divinity not underſtood, mens igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is to be pittied; when we preſſe dutie as in order to which Chriſt moveth, they ſay we preſſe it as merit, for which Chriſt muſt move: unbelief deſtroyeth ſpeciall providence <hi>à tanto li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet non à toto,</hi> in part though not in whole. Some things Chriſt doth to the ſoul, when it doth not beleeve, and that is to make faith; and other things he will not do till it doth believe, and yet doth all freely. In him not out of him do we conſiſt.</p>

Jacob had corn for neceſſity, and he had alſo the ſight of Joſeph and his poſterity, and the life of Benjamin, and many gallant mercies more, which bordered uppon theſe, even to the utmoſt of deſires, ſo literally was that promiſe fulfilled to him, <hi>thou ſatisfieſt the deſire of every living thing.</hi> Deſire is vaſter then neceſſity, in moſt creatures, in man it is <hi>I</hi> am ſure, and yet providence is ſo bountifull, that it ſatisfies this. Providence, not onely brings about what one needs, but what one wiſhes, yea more, providence doth prepare things, and beſtow this and that, which the heart cannot wiſh, nor expect; it doth prevent us with loving kindneſſe.</p>
               <p>Two things muſt be eyed, to mak Chriſt giue out himſelf plenteouſly, for your ſweet ſubſiſtence: the firſt is, <hi>intereſt. I am thine, ſave me,</hi> ſaith David. God is very tender about his own; a child ſhall have any thing. <hi>Remember me O Lord, with the favour that thou bareſt to [thy people] O viſit me with thy ſalvation.</hi> Union draws out all the fulneſſe of Chriſt; what goes beſide the pipes which are laid into the founntain, are but drops, and by means of theſe pipes too, theſe droppings are upon the world: Chriſt would not give forth a drop of favour to the world, were there not ſome in it nearely allied to him; all wicked mens mercies are but as it were ſome droppings of the great mercies of Saints; this kingdome would not conſiſt, were there not ſome Saints in it; all the upholding it hath is long of them that are united to him, from whom he cannot break off. England uſe thy Saints well they are thy pipes and veins to heaven, through which thy great bleſſings fall upon thee; All art muſt be uſed to advance intereſt in Chriſt; out of the favour of God, and you will be outed of all, whether it be the caſe of a perſon, or a whole nation. <hi>You are not my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and I will not be your God. Lo-ammi Lo-eli.</hi> This man is none of my child, let the devil look to him, let his own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:113418:68"/>
provide for him: this Kingdome is not my people, let it bleed to death and 'twill, will God ſay. England look to this or thou art loſt, and all the world ſhall not ſave thee; let thy reformation be ſuch as to render thee Chriſts Church, that he may ſay England is my people, or thy conſumption will kill thee. Friendſhip in Heaven is all, to the lively-hood of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or of a perſon here; every thing will run croſſe whileſt the great wheel is out with one: lets all ſet things right with Chriſt and all will run well, let diſadvantages be what they will. <hi>But thou Iſrael art my ſervant, Jacob whom I have choſen the ſeed of Abraham my friend; fear not for I am with thee, and they that warre againſt thee ſhall be as nothing.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Intereſt muſt be made and then maintain'd, or elſe life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh uncomfortable. When ſouls grow looſe they find the evill of their way: Chriſt is tender in providence to tender hearts. 'Tis harder to bring ones heart ſo near God as one ſhould, and then 'tis harder to keep it there; but yet how difficult ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the ſoul ſhall know it is a bitter thing to depart: a ſpirit of love and union abates, and then flowers that ſmell ſweet in the breaſt cloſe, and Chriſt withdrawes: <hi>My ſoul cleaveth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord, thy right hand upholdeth me,</hi> Pſalm, 93. The ſpirit of union muſt not be checked, it muſt work after the Lord freely: In this way the ſoul hath a right hand upholding it, and this maketh and keepeth the life contentfull. Grace is a purſuit of Chriſt, they live moſt ſweetly that runne moſt ſwiftly after him; check this purſuit and you die. Unbelief maketh fear, fear ſetteth the ſoul at a ſtand; ſhall I go forward, or ſhall I ſtand ſtill? Now God is diſpleaſed &amp; the heart tortured for its baſenes. Englands fearfulneſſe to purſue Chriſt, hath deprived her almoſt of ſubſiſtence, and tumbled her to nothing but bloud.

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:113418:68"/>
As a Prieſt Chriſt is <hi>head,</hi> as a Prophet Chriſt is <hi>head,</hi> as a King, Chriſt is <hi>head</hi> of the moſt beautifull body the Church: One word of God needeth many words of man to open it. Manna lieth of a heap here, and if Chriſt wait to be gracious, we ſhall gather much. We muſt begin with that which is the foundation of office, fulneſſe. Head noteth <hi>officium &amp; baſin of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficii,</hi> office and that which maketh ſufficience to office, Chriſt is called head <hi>quòd omnia in capite ſunt ferè dupla,</hi> as one ſaith, <hi>bini oculi, binae aures, binae nares,</hi> becauſe all things in the head are as it were double, there are two eyes, and two eares, and two noſtrils &amp;c. that is, a great fulneſſe of all exquiſite ſence and ability, for organiſation: and under this notion I purpoſe firſt to handle this tearm. Rule is a noble thing, Sun-beams weaved into a crown; he muſt be higher by the head then the reſt of Iſrael, that is, called out to wear this: perſon muſt be beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and parts double, and ſo were Chriſts, he is head: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>kaphal duplicavit, cùm omnia in capite ſunt ferè dupla;</hi> the head hath two eyes, two eares, two noſtrills, doubly organiſed to act it ſelf, and all the reſt; to ſupply it ſelf and all the reſt: ſo is Chriſt double endowed, not onely for himſelf, but for all that ſhall need him.</p>
               <p>Leviticall unctions were by pouring and not by dropping, enough was poured upon the head to run down to the feet: ſo is Chriſt anointed as head, that is, double grace is powred into his lips.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Giving is made in order to receiving, receptivitie is very vaſt in Chriſt, Chriſt can receive what ever God can give; the fulneſſe of the God-head dwelleth in him. God can do no great things in our ſpirits, they are ſo little. In Chriſt there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable capacity to infinite greatneſſe, and there God dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, furniſheth, and moveth as he is; double and treble dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made without end.

                  </label> Neceſſitous creatures conſider your condition, and where your ſupplies lie; 'tis ſad to ſee how poore many of you are: If there were no ſoul riches to be had, your poverty were no ſinne, but now your poverty is ſinfull miſery, and ſinfull miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is ſinking miſery; your poverty will judge you, becauſe there is wealth to be had; that you have no oyl will ſhut you out quite, becauſe there is oyl to be gotten were you wiſe to look after it, oyl enough to fill your lamps, to keep you burning and ſhining, till you go into that place where you ſhall ſhine for ever. Men in want lay to heart nothing, that maketh want ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly undoing; thouſands live and die damnable poore: do I not unawares ſpeak the condition of ſome of you? do ſoul wants lie heavie upon you?</p>
               <p>Yes, the nature of ſuch a condition ſhould be conſidered: ſoul-preſſures are from ſeverall apprehenſions, all are not kind; if this be not looked to, fulneſſe in Chriſt will not be looked after, though the heart be ready to die with load: there is ſoul-preſſure from conſcience enlightned: guilt by divine ordination looketh back upon the ſoul dayly, howerly, and the ſoul would look away from it, and think of no ſinne, nor no ſuch thing, but cannot, viſions of wrath ſo haunt him, and here lieth his load; if any company, if any muſick would cheere and charm away this evill ſpirit that ſo haunteth the man, he would get it what ever it did coſt: life though bad, not at all diſliked by the man, but horribly diſliked of God and conſcience, that the man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do what he would, he is ſo plagued within; and here lieth the burden, that the man cannot keep his ſinne, and not that he cannot leave his ſinne.</p>
               <p>Let ſuch men know, that that that arrow which is ſhot into
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:113418:69"/>
the heart, ſhall abide, and how able and full ſoever Chriſt be to power oyl into wounded ſouls, he will power none into theſe wounds, theſe ſhall gangrene and deſtroy the man, for they are <hi>diaboli ulcera;</hi> this is the burden of the damned, that they cannot proſecute their will, but are tormented. Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are pittied, which ſpring from love to Chriſt, and hatred of ſinne. I am ſick of love, Chriſt is my life, more then my life, but I cannot enjoy him, therefore I ſinne, ſink, grone and die: ſuch bleeding is ſtaid, ſuch wounds have mercy powred into them. Oppreſſed harts, do you prize the fulneſſe that is in Chriſt? O nothing dearer, then bleſſed are ye, for diſpenſation to you ſhall be full, you ſhall have flaggons. Previous diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, ſpeak the mercy coming certainly; the heavens glimmer in the eaſt, the ſunne is certainly riſing; affections ſtirre, the beloved is not farre off, the way is ſtrewed, the king is coming, there will be crying Hoſanna, and triumphing anon. Panting hearts, let the king come his own pace, and he will get home to you by night, he will <hi>ſup with you,</hi> and feaſt with you, and what ever he hath to refreſh and revive the ſoul, you ſhall have it, ere any temptation ſhall deſtroy you; Chriſt feaſting is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at ſupper, his full communications are ordinarily late, but never too late; fulneſſe of mercy, comes in fulneſſe of time. Let paſſions burn ſtrong, but not turbulent: if any thing make your beloved make haſte, and come skipping to you like <hi>a young Roe,</hi> it will be this. Chriſt comes in a ſtill voice, and unto ſtill ſouls, that long earneſtly, but wait patiently for him. Simeon waited for the conſolation of Iſrael, and he had his boſome full. Deep waters come ſlowly, infinite fulneſſe is long a emptying it ſelf. That w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> works exactly, muſt have time: grace that goeth forth in height goes forth very exact. <hi>Of his fulneſſe we receive, and grace for grace.</hi> Fulneſſe works exactly, to make the recipient fully like it ſelf, <hi>grace for grace.</hi> The beſt wine is kept till laſt. Full diſpenſations are beſt, the beſt wine, &amp; theſe are kept till laſt, and they are kept by Chriſt, <hi>thou hast kept</hi> the beſt wine till laſt. Grace goeth forth free, but not without order, no ſoul hath fulneſſe preſently, though Chriſt be fulneſſe alwayes.</p>
               <p>Veſſels of mercy are narrow mouthed (weak hearts, I ſpeak to you to keep you quiet). <hi>O ye of little faith.</hi> You have but
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:113418:70"/>
little faith, and yet complain that ye have not great mercy; ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe comes in, by opening the mouth <hi>wide:</hi> that dead ſoul that can <hi>ſpread</hi> himſelf upon the living, neeſes ſeven times; perfect life comes in, by ſpreading our ſouls upon him that is perfect. Every thing in Chriſt is mine, when faith ſaith this in the heart, then every thing indeed, actually becomes mine. The eye of Chriſt becomes mine to ſee, the hand of Chriſt becomes mine to work, and the feet of Chriſt becomes mine to walk. Our right lies as concealed, till faith acts; there is much in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, but the ſoul ſtarves, till it remember it ſelf, and own its father. <hi>I will return unto my father,</hi> and then I know I ſhall have bread enough, what he hath, I ſhall have: ſtrong acting of faith, makes Chriſts fulneſſe yours.</p>
               <p>Fulneſſe would fill your veſſells, but your hands jogge, and that runnes beſides, which ſhould runne in. There is never a time you come to theſe waters, but here is powring out enough to fill you all, but every ones hand jogges almoſt, ſo that much precious water is ſpilt, and every one returns empty. Jacob is ready to draw water, to water all, to fill the bellies of all the cattle, but Rachel will do it her ſelf, ſhe is ſhie and modeſt, and will not take help: Chriſt is willing to draw out his fulneſſe, and to fill every heart, but we are ſhie and modeſt, and will be doing all our ſelves, and not trouble Chriſt; we will be draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of this thing, and out of that duty to fill our ſouls, and not out of Chriſt. Let my beloved come into his garden, and do his work himſelf, for I can do no more; <hi>Blow O north-wind, Blow O ſouth, and make my ſpices flow out,</hi> for I beat and blow, and nothing will come out but ſinne and ſhame, this brings in fulneſſe; fulneſſe comes out of nothing. I am nothing, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, hearing nothing, but Chriſt all, and this makes him all unto the ſoul; the clearer in ſelf deniall, the fuller in the fruition of Chriſt. You reſt in your works, and ſtagger at the promiſe through unbelief, and how is it poſſible, that fulneſſe ſhould fill you. You are full of ſelf, and you cannot be full of Chriſt; the promiſes are pipes from the fountain, which are laid of purpoſe to fill you, and you ſtagger at them.</p>
               <p>I would every bleeding heart did know what wounds him, and who is his greateſt enemy; he thinks 'tis Chriſt, and alas
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:113418:70"/>
tis not: thou haſt not a dearer friend in the world then Chriſt is, nor one that pities thee more; thou art the greateſt enemy to thy ſelf, and thine own unbelief keeps thee low, this is the ſecret leak in the veſſell, which thou haſt not yet found out, thou hadſt been full elſe, long ere this. Chriſt is full, and art not thou full? Search thy ſoul, certainly there is ſome leak; unbelief is long ere it be ſeen, but when it is, no monſter like it; 'tis more uggly then Sathan, then that cage of unclean birds below, as that without which, Sathan nor ſinne could do any hurt. A ſtubborn child that had blaſphemed, was to be brought forth, and thoſe that heard him to blaſpheme, were to lay their hands on his head, and he was to be ſtoned. Unbelief is the froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the heart, which makes you to blaſpheme God, and his gracious word; bring forth this froward child, and lay your hands upon the head of it, and caſt ſtones at it at the throne of grace: ſay, Lord this is that child that hath blaſphemed thee, that hath diſhonoured thee more then any evil, ſtone it to death from heaven; this ſuit you muſt purſue and follow, which would be filled with the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Finally, fulneſſe ſpeaks ſuch diſpenſations, as make, and ſettle peace in the ſoul, and Chriſt is <hi>King of peace,</hi> he is <hi>King of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> he hath the command of peace; he can ſtill the raging ſea with a word of his mouth, ſo he can a raging conſcience, and he muſt be looked upon, and acknowledged, according to ſuch a tranſcendent abilitie, and then he gives out, as he hath in him, fulneſſe to ſupply the neceſſity of the ſoul. <hi>Lord I know that thou canst do whatever thou wilt.</hi> Now Chriſt works richly. Chriſt will have his prerogative acknowledged; grace is his own to diſpoſe as he will, all his wealth is his own, he can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance a ſoul at his pleaſure; if there be no word, which the ſoul ever yet heard, that hath ſpoken peace, Chriſt can create words, and make them ſo drop from his lips, as to make peace. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils are at the command of Chriſt, and Angels are at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, yea the holy Ghoſt is at the command of Chriſt, he can breath and blow with this wind, <hi>where he liſts:</hi> Chriſt is met half way (as it were) when the ſoul can thus look toward him, when Prerogative is fully acknowledged.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Every corporation hath priviledge, but none more then the Church; Jeruſalem is free, yet not lawleſſe, ſhe hath a head.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The rule of Chriſt is ſpirituall; he is head in the heart. <hi>The kingdome of God is within you,</hi> there are his Laws written, and there is his throne. Aarons rod, and the tables of the covenant, were in the inner Court, and the Manna <hi>in the golden pot.</hi> The command of the purſe may ſerve a man, but it doth not Chriſt, he commands the heart. <hi>My ſonne give me thy heart.</hi> You ſuit your ſeats, ſo doth Chriſt, he makes his throne in that which is neareſt him to wit, the ſpirit. Chriſts rule, is one ſoul bound up in another, Paul bound <hi>in the Spirit,</hi> and that bond, bound all to good behaviour.</p>
               <p>Chriſts rule is perpetuall. Some heads may be cut off, this head my text ſpeaks of cannot. Death hath ſlain many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, but Chriſt hath ſlain death, and him that had the

power of death. Satan is the executioner of Juſtice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaid to have <hi>the power of death,</hi> as well as in other reſpects; Chriſt hath deſtroyed all, and hath his life in jeopardy by none, he liveth and reigneth for ever, <hi>he ruleth by his power for ever,</hi> Pſalm, 66.7. He ſhall rule till he hath put down all rule, and all power, and all authority, 1. Cor. 15.24. Untill he and his be one, as he and his father are one till the <hi>kingdome be reſigned up.</hi> There be now many powers againſt Chriſt, but he muſt reign till they be all down, yet not any to help him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The rule of Chriſt is Monarchicall: there may be many lords over the body, but there is but one Lord over the ſoul, The government is upon <hi>his ſhoulders,</hi> that is, upon his alone. Chriſt had none ſuffered with him, and he hath none to reign with him here. Chriſt hath trod the wine-preſſe alone, he ſlew Goliah alone, and is that ſtone alone, that ſunk into his brain; he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his kingdome alone, and ruleth it alone: <hi>He ſhall build the Temple of the Lord, and he ſhall bear the glory, and ſhall ſit and rule upon his throne,</hi> Zacharie, 6.13.</p>

Office deſtroyed, the ſoul deſtroyeth it ſelf; where Chriſt can be no King, he will be no Jeſus: ſuch as ſtumble at this <hi>chief corner ſtone,</hi> are cruſhed by it; that ſoul that killed Chriſt, is killed by him, his bloud is upon every heart that nullifieth him. The Lord be mercifull to the ſouls of men: do ye know what ye do when you ſecretly ſay, this luſt ſhal reign, and Chriſt ſhal not reign over me? You commit Adoniahs treaſon, treaſon againſt the crown, that you may put by Solomon from the throne, your bloud and your life will go for this. When Adam committed treaſon againſt the crown, &amp; would become a God, God cutteth him off preſently, though there were no more men in the world.</p>
               <p>Juſtice hath its heights and depths as mercy hath: treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King hath exquiſite torture, ſuch a death as hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny deaths in it: ſo 'tis in this caſe, ſpirituall treaſon hath double death. <hi>By dying thou ſhalt die</hi> thou traitour againſt the crown of Heaven, ſaid Chriſt to Adam, and in him to all that do as he did. There is <hi>death unto death,</hi> and this the puniſhment of every traitour againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:113418:72"/>This is too generall: a more particular application ſhall be made. Your ſouls are under command, you have a ſpirituall head. You have fathers of your fleſh, and you obey them; you have a father of ſpirits, and why do ye not obey him? Moſt men look leaſt at their hearts, all the care is to order the tongue and the outward man. Hypocriticall creatures, you overlook the kingdome of Chriſt, you look at the outſide, Chriſt looketh at the heart, who ruleth within; all is under command, body and ſoul; the ſoul principally, and yet this principally neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed muſt needs be the death of all: thoughts muſt be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubjection to Chriſt, as well as words. Looſe hearts have their plague upon them, their holineſſe is painted, but their judgement will be reall, they have ſould their ſouls to do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and will be paid in hell. The behaviour of the heart is all, dethrone Chriſt and he will fight it out with you to the death; a diſloyall ſoul ſhall never have the ſword depart from him, not a quiet day as long as he liveth. Our temporall king which ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in this land, doth but imagine that you go about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne him, or take off ſome flowers from his crowns, and you ſee and feel that he fights it out with you to the death, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth reſolved not to give England a quiet day as long as he lives. Make ſpirituall application of this ye Hypocrites, ye painted toombs, that come here and profeſſe Chriſt, and go out like Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das and betray him, you dethrone Chriſt in your hearts, you deſtroy the flowers of his crown; the rule of the ſoul is the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flower of his crown, and taking away this from him, he will fight it out with you to the death, the ſword ſhall never depart from your ſouls, you ſhall not have a quiet day, for the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie which you know.</p>
               <p>Tremble Hypocrites, fearfulneſſe will ſurpriſe you, your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret baſeneſſe will generate a ſecret hell, juſtice ſhall rule where truth and love cannot: the rottenneſſe of your hearts ſhall have a coraſite to feed upon it for ever; let every one lay theſe things to heart, and conſider whether Chriſt be head there yea, or no.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Two things demonſtrate the heart indeed ruled by Chriſt, ſin univerſally hated, and truth univerſally loved. Paſſions are falſe, ſtrength ſpeaketh out their truth, and who ruleth in the

heart. Some ſpirits are indifferent for truth or errour, and hold a virtue to be hot for neither, but to ſtand in all times of contradiction, ſo as to keep the skinne whole; Hypocriſie ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in this heart and not truth, and this temper is the plague of this generation, neither hot nor cold. Cold ſweats are death pangs; the ſoul is near his end that thus liveth. If God be God worſhip him, halting between many things is nothing, this ſpeaketh the prince of darkneſſe yet ruling: affections which break through obſtacles to diſcharge duty, ſpeak Chriſt head in the heart.</p>
               <p>I will not ſtand on qualities themſelves, but at what every quality maketh, and this will be more plain to you to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate who ruleth in your hearts. Fire encounters all oppoſites, ſo doth every element from a naturall inſtinct, and ſo doth grace where it reigneth. Sinne is the proper object of hatred, and every ſinne is made ſo where Chriſt indeed is head. Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſpeaketh all ſubdued, if any ſinne reign Chriſt doth not. Weak hearts muſt not here wrong themſelves: the being of ſinne and the ſtirring of ſinne, which the Apoſtle calleth the <hi>motion of ſinne,</hi> do not neceſſarily ſpeak the reign of ſinne. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny precious hearts when they feel ſinne ſtrong in them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it reigneth in them, and cenſure their ſouls exceedingly, and ſo make their life a hell; they pleaſe themſelves in this, but Chriſt is not pleaſed. Sinne maketh motions: that is nothing, how is it harkned to? This denominateth dominion or not: doth every ſtirring make thee grone? <hi>wretched man,</hi> &amp;c. Doſt thou carry ſinne to Chriſt, when it is about to carry thee to the Devil? Lord, this is the plague of my heart, heal it; this univerſally practiced ſpeaketh the reign of Chriſt: ſome of you are by pangs plaintifes againſt corruption, and then another while defendants; and plaintifes againſt one corruption, upon ſome more then ordinary evil that falleth out upon it, and then defendants in reference to another, that taketh better to your deſignes: this mans eyes are out, and Satan hath him by the hand, and the Lord knoweth whither he will lead him.</p>
               <p>You that cannot ſo well underſtand this, may conſider the next: Sinne univerſally hated, <hi>Truth univerſally loved</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſts dominion indeed in the ſoul. Truth is homogeneall,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:113418:73"/>
and is all ſweet to a ſweet ſoul; the heart conquered by Chriſt, all his Lawes are <hi>holy, just and good.</hi> Chriſts yoke is eaſie, and burdenſome things light: Truth is no preſſure, not ſimply as a truth (I think) where the ſoul is ſincere; the preſſure is, if any, that it cannot love enough, nor obey enough things of ſuch a noble nature. One of the firſt things Chriſt taketh is love, here he fortifieth till he hath taken all other parts; here he mounteth cannons againſt all that is naught, and iſſueth out from hence, and taketh in all that is truth. Love is Chriſts fort-Royall in the ſoul, mighty vaſt, and holdeth play on all ſides, for all truth, and againſt all ſinne. A ſoul under the command of Chriſt <hi>loveth much,</hi> though he can do but little, loveth all truths, though he can ſcarce practice one. Chriſt is a King of glory, into whatſoever everlaſting doores he cometh: every line in Chriſts book is glorious, every hair upon Chriſts head glorious, where he is a head. Chriſts head is buſhy and black as a Raven; lines of truth are black hairs of that head that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, and they are all beautifull in that heart that is married to Chriſt. The ſumme of all is this, as Chriſt ruleth in the heart ſo is the life; you may look without and ſee who ruleth within; a through converſation ſpeaketh a through dominion of Chriſt, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Having ſpoke to diſcover, a few things more I would deliver to draw your hearts to come under the rule of Chriſt: Whom Chriſt ruleth he defendeth; power attendeth truth, Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth goings in his paths: men may juſtle againſt us, but Chriſt will uphold. Chriſt will make his own way, and lead bravely if men would but follow him: this is all that Chriſt calls for, that men will but follow him. <hi>Follow me</hi> ſaith he often, and I will make you this, and make you that. Chriſt will make his way rhrough the blond of thouſands, through the bloud of Towns, Cities, Kingdomes, but he will have his own Kingdome ſtand. Malice ſtrikes craftily and deſperately, yet this head will ward as well; no evil ſhall accompliſh its end, as long as Chriſt reigneth; <hi>Why do the Heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?</hi> The wrath of God maketh the wrath of man <hi>vain</hi> in its hotteſt purſuit. <hi>He is dead that ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thy life,</hi> ſaith the holy Ghoſt.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Chriſt delighteth thoſe which he ruleth: through obedience takes Chriſt Chriſt taken expreſſeth it. <hi>This is my beloved Sonne in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> Chriſt did throughly obey and he fed upon the ſweet of it here, he had <hi>meat to eat</hi> in this world, which none <hi>knew of.</hi> There is no ſtraight when a man doth his duty, Chriſt maketh enlargement in bonds; joy in ſorrow, life, in death. Chriſt doth counterwork the world; there deſire is to rob us of peace, and rob us of joy; but it ſhall not be ſaith Chriſt, <hi>In me you ſhall have peace,</hi> what ever you meet with in the world. Wiſdomes wayes are pleaſant, when bloudy: when men are froward, Chriſt is kind; the churliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Laban. made God ſpeak often and very ſweetly to Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob. Chriſt ſmileth upon tender conſciences, when the world frowneth; his boſome is open to give reſt, when the ſighing ſpirit breatheth out it ſelf to him. <hi>What is thy requeſt Heſter?</hi> will pride trample thee under foot? It ſhall not. As no time is unſeaſonable to ſhew duty to Chriſt, ſo no time unſeaſonable for an obedient ſoul to find favour with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Finally, whom Chriſt ruleth he crowneth: obedience maketh loſſe, and Chriſt thinketh of this, and worketh it to gain in another world. Duty maketh laying out, and yet laying up; laying out of name, ſtate, ſtrength, life on earth, and laying up of other guiſe things then theſe in Heaven. <hi>Hence forth is [laid up] for me a crown</hi> &amp;c. What you loſe in earth, Chriſt layes it up in Heaven, and when you come home you ſhall have it again with advantage; your name again your eſtate again, your life again, all that you looſe in obedience to your heavenly head and ſoveraign. Chriſt doth nothing in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to merit, but much in order to bounty. <hi>If you ſuffer with him, you ſhall reign with him:</hi> Spiritually fight and maintain Chriſt a King, and he will crown you Kings.

                  <hi>head-prieſt, Prince-Prieſt,</hi> as the Greek word notes both, and as the authour to the Hebrews uſeth the word. Chriſt bears office to the creature, but no inferiour office: he doth officiate to rule the body, but 'tis as the chief Commander: he doth officiate to ſave the body, but 'tis as chief-prieſt, as head-prieſt, as prince-prieſt, as king of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I will demonſtrate the principality of Chriſts Prieſthood or Prieſts office. The deſignation of Chriſt to his Prieſtly office is noble: we are ſacrificers, according to the law of a carnall commandment, our ordination is from men, but his from God; the Counſel of State above ſets out this embaſſadour of peace; <hi>called of God, an high prieſt,</hi> Heb. 5.10.

Chriſt had not onely his ordination by joynt proteſtation, but by oath. What a man is inveſted with by word from the kings own mouth, is very noble; the word of a king hath a great ſtate in it, but the oath of a king added makes double and treble ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; yet ſo is Chriſt inveſted with his Prieſtly office: <hi>The Lord hath ſworn and will not repent, Thou art a Priest for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As Chriſts Prieſtly ordination was princely, ſo his taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle in which he officiates princely, it is as ſtately as heaven. Chriſt doth officiate his princely office in heaven, which was ſhadowed out by Aarons officiating in the inward court, in the moſt holy place yearly. <hi>We have ſuch an high prieſt which is ſet on the throne in the majeſtie in the heavens,</hi> Hebr. 8.1. <hi>A miniſter of the Sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle.</hi> Chriſt hath upon his mitre a crown in heaven, and he ſits upon a

throne of ſtate at the right hand of God, as a princely Prieſt, ſacrificing in a princely tabernacle, ſprinkling the mercy-ſeat, where offended juſtice himſelf fits, to make all communication to man. Aarons tabernacle the Apoſtle calls <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>umbra, a ſhadow,</hi> as rather the ſhadow of a tabernacle, then indeed a tabernacle, then a <hi>true tabernacle;</hi> a houſe of boughs, a leafie houſe: Chriſt is miniſter of <hi>the true tabernacle.</hi> There was gold and ſtate in the firſt tabernacle, but it was all but painting, as it were; in the tabernacle where Chriſt ſacrifices, there is true ſtate, the gold that is in heaven is true gold; the golden cenſer that is there is true gold, the golden altar that is there is true gold. Truth is the principality of things, ſuch is Chriſts tabernacle, 'tis as true as heaven. Chriſt hath his tabernacle as he hath ordination, after a very immediate, and a very ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way: Aarons tabernacle was pitched by man, bur Chriſts by God himſelf: <hi>He is a miniſter of the true tabernacle which the Lord hath pitch'd, and not man.</hi> Aarons tabernacle was pitch'd with hands, and made with hands, but Chriſt is a high Prieſt in a more perfect tabernacle, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, not of this creation, of another creation, and of another fixation.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Chriſts ſacrifice is noble, and princely as well as the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle: he offers like a Prince, royall bloud, not the bloud of bulls and goats, which is bruitiſh bloud; but his own bloud. <hi>Neither by the bloud of goats and calves, but by his own bloud he entred in once into the holy place, &amp;c.</hi> Life is a noble thing, you have not ſuch another jewell about you; but a ſpotleſſe life is doubly noble, ſuch bloud did Chriſt offer. Life is a jewell in which all is wrapt up, a man offers all when he offers this, and that's a noble offering indeed. The widow threw in all, which was a noble offering, ſo hath Chriſt. 'Tis noble action for a great Peere, to take his life in his hand, and ſay, This ſhall go for my kingdome, Chriſt is the greateſt Peere that ever the world ſaw, and yet he took his life in his hand, and ſaid, This ſhall go for my kingdome, and my people: <hi>I lay down my life for my ſheep.</hi> If Chriſt had laid down the life of all creatures for man, it had been a noble ſacrifice, but he ſaith, <hi>I lay down [my life,]</hi> and then tell me what nobility is in this offering? Judas valued this bloud baſely, but God that values things as they

are, takes it of more price then all your ſouls, and yet every one of which is of more price then the world.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Chriſt doth officiate a very noble covenant, he offers fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe bloud, and he officiates a faultleſſe covenant.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>'Tis hard to convince men that they truſt in their works, though the thing ſpeaks it ſelf in moſt mens conſciences. Two things will diſcover this ruining cheat. Firſt, conſider what doth move you to duty: ſome perſons would never pray, nor never do any holy duty, were it not for mere fear: they open their mouths heaven-ward now and then, to ſtop the mouth of hell, that is, juſtice in their own conſcience. This man makes his holineſſe his high prieſt, his own action his interceſſour to bring him to heaven, which if it do, then I will anſwer for him at the great day. Obſerve are ſpring of action, and nothing will more plainly ſpeak, whether you make a Jeſus of action. I am afraid there are ſouls very ignorant amongſt you: blind wretches, ſo they be but doing ſomething that is called holineſſe, 'tis enough to them, here they reſt and look their ſouls: when affrighted by a ſremon, by the word, or the rod of God, then they down upon their knees, and howl and cry, like the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in the ſhip that Jonah ſailed in. A toſſed condition is the onely mother of moſt mens devotion, toſſed without, or toſſed within, and therefore ſo good, and yet alas all is ſtark naught. Chriſt is no prieſt to this man, no chief prieſt, no prince-prieſt, his own action is his prime prieſt, becauſe 'tis truſted in. Blind wretches, conſider what kindles your zeal, your conſcience will

Sence is ſome ſouls onely relief; if duty oyl not its own wheels, the ſoul ſtands ſtill; they can find no ſweet in prayer, therefore pray no more, duty will not conjure their conſciences quiet, and therefore they will to the alehouſe, and ſee whether carnall devils will drive out uncarnall, whether one hell will ſwallow up another; the pleaſures of the fleſh muſt take off the terrours of the ſpirit: Ah Lord! what a black prieſt is here uſed! This ſoul is deſparate, the devil hath ordination to prieſthood, and the alehouſe, or whore-houſe muſt be his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle to officiate in; hands are laid on him ſuddenly, and this made the laſt remedie to eaſe and quiet the ſoul. Here is a ſad condition: O that I could ceaſe preaching, and weep now in the face of ſuch a forlorn wretch. Will that which dames you, ſave you? Will ſinne blot out ſinne? Will adding to tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, plead for mercy in heaven, to quiet your conſciences, and ſave your ſouls? The devil is <hi>Abaddon</hi> a deſtroyer, no ſaviour, ſo is ſinne. When your ſouls are wounded, will you give them to ſinne and the devil to heal? the ſpirit of God will finally leave you for this, ſo it did Saul for the like practiſe. Rebellion makes wounds, and when wounds heighten rebellion, God will have no more to do with that man. Let the ſoul bleed and bleed, and ordain what prieſt it will, Chriſt will not bleed for him.

Double conſolation ſprings from the prieſthood of Chriſt, firſt in regard of infirmitie. You would be pitied concerning your weakneſſes, and compaſſion is naturall to Chriſt, he is a <hi>mercifull high prieſt,</hi> and can be no other to you. God hath ordained him to officiate in ſuch a tabernacle, as wherein you dwell, he is in <hi>all things like to you:</hi> you are in want, and ſo was Chriſt, he had no houſe: you are perſecuted, ſo was Chriſt: ſinne loads you, and ſo it did Chriſt. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians condition needs compaſſion, and Chriſt knows how much,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:113418:76"/>
and 'tis his work continually to lay it open above. There are infirmities diſtinct from a wounded ſpirit, you know the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture makes ſuch a diſtinction, Common diſtreſſes have their weight, and 'tis more then the beſt ſoul can bear theſe, if it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain not an eye to the compaſſion of Chriſt: men are wolves, dogs, they have no bowels, and the ſoul beats it ſelf to death with this, till it remember the bowels of Chriſt. When good hearts have no compaſſion on earth, they are ready to conclude they have none in heaven, but you cannot injure Chriſt and your ſouls more, then by ſuch concluſions: Chriſt lets men be mercileſſe, that you may look up, and behold how mercifull he is, and that he needs not this channell or that, to convey com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion in to you. Weeping eyes, ſight fails them oft, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion never fails: 'tis mercy that a man can weep to God, and do no worſe, when he can get no mercy from man. Doth not relief ſtrangely come in now and then? Why, write upon the forehead of ſuch favours, I have a mercifull and compaſſionate mediatour in heaven, my interceſſour above ſent me this, and he will ſend me more; Chriſt hath ſounding of bowels. <hi>Where are the ſounding of thy bowels</hi> you may heare them from heaven to earth, in the moſt diſtreſſed condition, if you liſten and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve diligently in all paſſages about you.</p>

Chriſt is able to ſave to the uttermoſt: the dolefull cry of the wounded is, my ſinnes will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forgiven. Silence unbelief, be not tyrannicall to thy ſelf, for Chriſt will not, ſinne ſhall do thee no hurt, nor Sathan, no nor God, for Chriſt can work him to any thing; if hel but open his wounds in heaven, he will ſo work his father, that thy wounds on earth will cloſe preſently. Chriſt is a perfect media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, and being <hi>made perfect, he became the Authour of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſalvation, unto all them that obey,</hi> Hebr. 5.9. Either the wound of a Chriſtian lies in the greatneſſe of the evill which he hath done, or in the fear of what he ſhall do againſt God, and God againſt him; to all which I ſay onely this, that Chriſt is a <hi>perfect mediatour,</hi> and being a perfect mediatour, no condition can be deſperate.</p>

As King, Chriſt is head; as Prieſt, Chriſt is head; (and of theſe we hove ſpoken) as Prophet, Chriſt is head. Chriſt ruleth, none like him; Chriſt ſacrificeth, none like him: Chriſt teacheth, none like him. <hi>He ſpake as never man ſpake,</hi> Learned men were aſtoniſhed at his doctrine. <hi>Whence hath this man theſe things, and what wiſdome is this given unto him,</hi> Mark, 2.6.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I will demonſtrate the ſuperiority of Chriſts propheticall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Chriſt doth otherwiſe receive and otherwiſe imparts then ever any Prophets or Teachers did. Viſions were tranſient to the Prophets, the word of the Lord <hi>came to them,</hi> and then went away again. Balaam in a trance could ſee much, and then of a ſudden ſaw nothing no more then another man: ſo it was with the greateſt Prophets; ſeers, and then in the dark again; the ſpirit of the Lord was tranſient, and came and went from one to another. That bad man intimateth this truth that I tell you, which ſtruck the Prophet, and ſaid, <hi>Which way went the ſpirit of the Lord from me to thee,</hi> Viſion is an abiding thing in Chriſt: light abideth in the Sunne; it doth ſo to day, it doth ſo to morrow, and it doth ſo for ever. Chriſt ſeeth much to day, as much to morrow, and as much to all eternity: his eye is not darkned, the ſpirit of the Lord is not accidentally but naturally in him: the Sonne <hi>lieth in the boſome</hi> of the Father. <hi>No man hath ſeen God at any time, the onely begotten which is in the boſome of the Father, he hath revealed him.</hi> I think theſe terms of Father, and Sonne, and boſome, they point at the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalneſſe
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:113418:77"/>
of Chriſts ability, to explicate infinite excellency. There is no new thing to Chriſt under the Sunne, no nor above the Sun; no new thing to Chriſt in earth, nor in Heaven, nor in the boſome of God: Chriſt is never at a loſſe, reſpecting the knowledge of things above or below, preſent or to come; he never needeth inſtruction from any in this thing or that; <hi>Who hath instructed him?</hi> The lamp in the Tabernacles went out, and Viſion did fail, or at leaſt it is conceived ſo by ſome of the learned, which undertake to interpret theſe things, but the lamp in the true Tabernacle never goeth out, nor viſion never fails. <hi>Light dwelleth with him,</hi> Daniel 2.22. As the ſpirit dwelleth in the body, as the eye dwelleth in the head, which confirmeth me more in that which I ſaid before, concerning the natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſts abilities.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Viſion to the Prophets was of this or that particular thing. The greateſt ſeers, were not <hi>cunctis oculati,</hi> ſeers in all things; in ſome things they knew much, and in other things nothing. David a great Prophet, and a very knowing man, yet in ſome points a <hi>beast.</hi> The greateſt Doctours knew but in part, skild in this knowledge or that, each had their particular eminency. But Chriſt hath <hi>all wiſdome,</hi> and <hi>all knowledge:</hi> He is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly skild in all the wiſdome of the Egyptians to uſe that alluſion, but he is skild in all the wiſdome and learning that is in this world, or in any other world. In Chriſt is all wiſdome and all knowledge; yea all the treaſures of theſe: the ſpring of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is admired for light and skil amongſt the Sonnes of men. <hi>In him are hid all the treaſures of wiſdome and knowledge,</hi> Coloſs. 2. His eyes runne through the earth, ſo they do Heaven, and he maſters all he looks upon; <hi>his underſtanding is infinite,</hi> and this without ſtudy <hi>primo intuitu,</hi> at the firſt look. There are but few things that lie naked before you, you are fain to make a ſtand at every thing, to make underſtanding but Chriſt makes a ſtand at nothing, for <hi>all things are naked [before him,</hi> that is, he looketh upon all, and underſtandeth all preſently, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of a thing, and underſtanding of it are the ſame; <hi>He is quick of underſtanding</hi> ſaith the Prophet. The Lamb opens <hi>ſealed books;</hi> and though all dark ſayings to every one elſe, yet he readeth and underſtandeth preſently; when there was none

found to open the book, the Lamb could, and therefore called <hi>Palmoni</hi> by Daniel, <hi>the revealer of ſecrets.</hi> Dark things and plain things, day and night are all one to him. <hi>He revealeth deep and ſecret things, he knoweth what is in the darkneſſe,</hi> Dan. 2.22. the revelations delivered by John, are called <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of Christ; The revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, which God gave unto him, &amp;c.</hi> Revel. 1.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Viſion to the Prophets was by a borrowed power, their light was not connaturall, but ſupernaturall to them. Light is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall to the Sonne, it is not onely naturall, but connaturall, my meaning is, equally naturall to the Sonne, as to the Father. The Father and the Sonne are one, their power one, their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome one, they are one in hand, one in tongue, one in viſion and ſight. Chriſt ſees of himſelf, with his own eyes he ſees all things, and as exquiſitely as the Father, as exquiſitely as he from whom he receives. What Chriſt hath as an officer, he hath it not in way of talent, intereſt, and inferiority, as you have things; but he hath it as his own, and as his own joyntly and equally with the Father. <hi>Moſes was faithfull as a ſervant, but he as a Sonne in [his own houſe.</hi> The Church militant here, and the Church triumphant above, that is to ſay, grace and glory, they are all Chriſts own, even as they are his Fathers; and if there be any thing beyond theſe, it is Chriſts own too, even as it is Gods own: which I think that expreſſion points at, where he ſaith, <hi>Glorifie me with [thine own ſelf] with the glory that [I had with thee] before the world was.</hi> Grace is as properly Chriſts own, and as fully Chriſts own, as ſinne is ſaid to be the devils own; when the devil tells a lie, <hi>he tells it of his own,</hi> that is, he doth that which is naturall to him, and that wherein there can be no ſuperiour to him, to lie more facilly nor more exquiſitely then he. So what truth Chriſt ſpeaks, he ſpeaks it of his own, that is, that wherein he is naturall, and not ſupernaturall, and as it were above himſelf, and that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is equally full and paralell to any ſpeaker of it connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall with any that ſpeaks this language. The paralell ſtate of Chriſt with the Father, in point of imparting ſpirituall things, is hinted methinks in that form of ſpeech which the Apoſtle James uſeth, chap. 1. 18. <hi>Of his [own will] he begat us [with

The prince of darkneſſe fortifieth within us, and Chriſt can mount ordnances where the forts are, &amp; ſhoot off terribly within, and deſtroy <hi>the works of the devil,</hi> that is, ſinne, or the ſoul at every ſhot: Chriſt doth with his cannon within, as you do with yours without, rend and tear wofully: You take off bodies in the very midſt, ſo doth Chriſts cannon take off ſinnes and ſouls in the very midſt, as Beza renders that word <gap reason="foreign">

We ſpeak words, and they ſtick but a moment, Chriſt ſpeaks words and they ſtick for ever. We make wounds, and you lick them whole in an alehouſe; Chriſt makes wounds that no art can heal; <hi>Thy arrows ſtick faſt in me,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. The arrows which Chriſt ſhoot, they <hi>ſtick faſt,</hi> none can pull them

The wiſdome of the world is fooliſhneſſe with God: I do not ask you how knowing you are in your particular cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as ſuch and ſuch tradeſ-men; but how knowing you are in your generall calling as Chriſtians; how knowing of Chriſt and your ſouls? Light is come into the world, a great light: Do you ſee the way to heaven? Confidence ſpeaks not ſaving light, but deſperate blindneſſe; many ignorant men conceit they know much, when they know nothing as they ought. The fool is wiſe in his own conceit, and the world is full of theſe fools; yea, the Chriſtian world is full of theſe fools; but Chriſt is emptying it. Blindneſſe and confidence makes us all bloudy at this day, and the Lord grant it make us not bleed to death. We have a Laodicean plague upon us, and God ſeems to be ſpuing us out of his mouth, and yet our Laodicean ſpirit lives in the midſt of us. We all of us think highly of our ſelves, that we are rich in all ſpirituall excellencies, and they that contradict our conceits are fools. <hi>We are fools,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>but you are wiſe:</hi> How ſtrong, and how generall this ſpirit is now, you that are ſpirituall may ſee, and what it preſages Chriſt will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain fully, if you can but hold faſt a little.</p>

When things touch your conſciences, then you rage, and then the Miniſter is mad, becauſe you are mad. Alas for us! Lord thou makeſt us men of contention, our life is a fighting with beaſts that will not underſtand us nor thee. If you had no other Prophets but us, or did reject no other prophet but us, ſome diſpute might be made in the day of account; but we will not judge you to the Father, there is another prophet which you hear in us, and yet will not heare, and it is he that will judge you to the Father, and to your own conſciences. If this will not beat off men from deluding themſelves, and from bearing off Chriſt, I will go on.</p>
               <p>Some ſpirits are wanton: as there be light bodies, ſo there be light ſouls, ſuch as go a whoring after lies. Fanſie ſick, longs after freſh ſpeculation, if this may be had it ſatisfies, let it be in what it will, in things as farre from Chriſt as earth is from heaven, yea as hell is from heaven. It is otherwiſe with the ſoul that is taught of God, he hath a little light of Chriſt, and now cares for no other viſion; all light is darkneſſe, and all wiſdome folly, that relates not to make Chriſt more known: <hi>I purpoſe to know nothing but Chriſt, and him crucified.</hi> Paul had many endowments, but they were all ſleighted. Chriſt teacheth the heart, as the heart is taught, love burns; nothing ſatisfies love, but what ſtird it: if ſuch an object made love, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the fruition of that object will ſatisfie it. You may know whether Chriſt hath opened any thing of himſelf to you, by your love to him: the purity of your light will ſpeak out it ſelf in the purity of your love, and the purity of your affection in the purity of your action. Should you ſay nothing, yet a man that ſtands by you, may tell what your light is, and who hath taught your hearts, Chriſt or the devil. Some of you will ſwear, and curſe, and lie; ſome of you your love as fleſhly, as baſe as the earth it ſelf: Hath Chriſt taught ſuch things as theſe? No certainly, the devil is the tutour of theſe, and they will take their degree in hell. I have a word to you all, and

A looſe life broadly ſpeaks out an uninſtructed heart: what ſecretly ſwayes, Chriſt ſees, and ſo ſhall all the world, uſe what art you will to hide it; wherein you are intractable to the teaching of Chriſt, God will diſcover it, and require it.

I have ſet <hi>my king upon my holy hill.</hi> The world is full of variety of condition, ſo is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine action ſhaped every one hath as he is: Iron hearts have an iron ſcepter to order them, and hearts of a more noble met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, have a ſcepter of gold, every one hath a ſuitable offendant.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Gods way in this world, is nothing elſe, but a tracing of man: you eat but the fruit of your own way, when 'tis moſt bitter. A people of wrath, have a king in wrath, there was diſpenſation exactly ſuited. This is the carriage of God through out the world, he doth not work at randome, he ſquares action to the thing he works about, and fits one thing to another. I am ſent to <hi>loſt ſheep,</hi> ſaith the Saviour. God directs a Saviour to loſt man, and a Phyſitian to ſick man; and to blind and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, which think they ſee, Chriſt is ſent to move in juſtice to them: juſtice naturally ſuits all her actions to the ſubject, about which ſhe works, as mercy doth. I am come for judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men into the world, ſaith Chriſt, to ſhape action to perſon, to ſuit diſpenſation to condition.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The Deitie ſpeaks out it ſelf in apt action. Some men cannot, and others will not underſtand God in his word, ſuch muſt be dealt with another way; men that will not reade words, have apt works annexed to explain them. Divine action ſuited to humane, renders God as it were viſible to men born blind: let him that did cut off other limbs, have his own cut off, and be ſerved juſt as he hath ſerved others, and he will ſee a righteous God preſently, which could not ſee it before, and you will have him ſpeak good divinity preſently, by virtue of ſuch apt action
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:113418:81"/>
annexed to the word, which could not underſtand a word of divinity before. <hi>As I have dealt with others, ſo God hath requited me,</hi> ſaid Adonibezek; it is a rare artiſt that can draw out himſelf, and yet this is naturall to God; by words and works together, he will draw out himſelf ſo plain, that any one ſhall runne and reade him. God can cut and hew a block ſo by line, ſo exact by the line of the word, and the manners of men, that you or any one elſe, the very block it ſelf, ſhall tell who and what hand did it. <hi>So God hath requited me,</hi> Perſons that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reade, are ſet to ſpell words by works, their own works by Gods works. God can draw out himſelf in any attribute, to any mans underſtanding, in juſtice, in mercy. God can ſuit action to any perſon, to any condition, and ſo exactly that at firſt ſight every eye ſhall ſee himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Divine action is to make conviction: Chriſt worketh ſo as to convince the world, he fitteth his hand to ſtop any mouth. Some are not onely blind, but ſtubborn and dogged, and now is man an Aſſe, which was Balaams caſe, and now God opens the mouth of an Aſſe to rebuke him. <hi>The Aſſe rebuked the madneſſe of the Prophet.</hi> An Aſſe is a dogged wilfull beaſt, and ſo was Balaam, and God ſuits him in reproof, to convince. One Aſſe was upon the back of another, and the worſt a top, and God tooke his advantage as they lay one upon another, and uſeth one Aſſe to convince the other: one is wilfull to go on, and the other is wilfull and ſtops. 'Tis not eaſie to convince ſtubborn ſouls, God muſt more immediately, and more exactly ſpeak then ordinary in this work: Divine action ſuited is an immediate ſpeaking from Heaven, and proud hearts fall at the ſight of this, when nothing elſe will do it. Some muſt have every thing openly told to their face, ere they will be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and take ſhame, and God doth uſe this way with the world to convince them. <hi>Who ſhall declare his way to his face? and who ſhall repay him what he hath done,</hi> ſaith the Scripture of God in order to wicked men, Job 21.31. Juſtice ſuited to ſinne in word and work, ſpeaks ſinners ſinne to their face, that they cannot poſſibly deny it.</p>
               <p>Sinners look to your ſelves, God will be even with
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:113418:82"/>
you, walk as craftily as you will, with the froward he will be froward. Some men ſwell in pride, and yet pleaſe themſelves in their way, that they ſhall carry all before them without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll. Lofty hearts, you ſhall find a high and lofty one to deal with you, <hi>The day of the Lord of Hoſts ſhall be upon every one that is proud and lofty,</hi> and this is the ſpeech of a lofty God, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay 2.12. title is advanced, brows bended, a ſouldiers face put on by God, when fleſh ſwelleth and groweth proud. <hi>The day of the Lord of Hoſts ſhall be upon the proud,</hi> &amp;c. A ſtern ſpirit ſhall ſee nothing but a ſtern God. Sinne is a lie, ſinners periſh in the heat of their purſuit, one fire kindleth another; ere firy ſpirits are aware, they are caſt into everlaſting burning, and this is the way of God to fit things one to and for another. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet is prepared for the King; the Kings of Iſrael made a To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet for the burning of little ones, and God ſuiteth this wicked action with righteous juſtice, and maketh another Tophet for them; you ſacrifice your children to the devil, and I will ſacrifice you; as if the Lord had ſaid; God maketh burning for burning, bloud for bloud, tooth for tooth. Poore diſtreſſed England, comfort thy ſelf, thy Princes and Nobles make a Tophet for thee; they burn thy houſes, thy goods, and ſacrifice thy little ones and great ones to devilliſh men, and God will fit them home if they repent not, he will make a Tophet for them, he will burn their honours, their powers, and ſacrifice all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; he will turn them out of all, as they turn thee and thine, <hi>Becauſe thou hast dealt by taking vengeance, thou ſhalt know my vengeance,</hi> ſaith God to Edom.</p>
               <p>In great extremities it is hard to keep poore hearts quiet, the ſpirit woundeth it ſelf when men wound the fleſh: God is juſt to me in this and that, I was thus and thus. Is God juſt to thee, and will he not be juſt to them that ſpoyled thee? Hath he paid thee home, and will he not do it to them that are worſe then thee? Juſtice in the exactneſſe of it, doth but hint her ſelf to the godly, it doth but nod upon them as it were, but ſhe ſtrikes full blowes at the wicked, ſhe proſecuteth her own nature in full ſtrength, and maketh a compenſation upon theſe creatures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe none made, nor to be had any where elſe. Weep not for
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:113418:82"/>
your ſelves, but weep for them that have ſpoyled you, Heaven and Earth ſhall reade the juſtice of God againſt the bloudy wretches of England and Ireland. <hi>They that kill with the ſword ſhall be killed with the ſword.</hi> Stand ſtill and be quiet, let God alone to ſuit wicked mens plagues, if thou doſt not ſee them paid in their own coyn, then do not believe me.</p>
               <p>England, juſtifie Chriſt: he hath fitted one thing to another, ſuch a body hath ſuch a head, like Prieſt, like people; like Prince, like people. You cry out of your king, and I cry out of you; <hi>Are not Gods wayes equall?</hi> Say no, who dares. You will not have a man rule over your bodies according to his will, and you let the devil rule your ſouls as he will. Looke into your hearts the beſt of you all, do you not make truth a ſlave, to be at the beck of your reaſon, and at the beck of your luſts? you make Chriſt a ſlave, and he giveth you to be ſlaves; you make your ſpirituall king a ſlave, and your temporall kings make you ſlaves. Doth not Chriſt fit you in your kind? Our king is ſo and ſo miſled ſaith one, and ſiths and whiſpers: take it to thy ſelf, ſo art thou miſled by many baſe luſts: every one reapeth as he ſoweth; <hi>can a man gather figs of thiſtles.</hi> England doſt not thou reap as thou haſt ſowed? Haſt thou not had the guilt of bloud upon thee a great while? haſt not thou the guilt of the bloud of many abroad, and of many faithfull miniſters and Chriſtians at home upon thee, which could not ſwallow thy baſeneſſe? Haſt thou not made truth bleed this many years? and that Chriſt maketh the bleed a few moneths, and a few years, is it not fit and right? To juſtifie God is the firſt ſtep to repentance: men that can do nothing but wrangle at divine action, forget the main work. Do not bite the ſtone that is thrown at thee, but bite thy heart; for one is as hard as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I dare ſay. Pride meriteth much, but can bear but little, but juſtice will have its way for all that. Men that cannot be ſilent. ſhall have their mouths ſtopt: miſery becometh mortall, when impatience groweth ſtrong; the burden killeth, when the ſoul will uſe no ſhoulders to bear it. No life ſo bitter as that which taketh all ill at Gods hand; this is hard, and that is hard, &amp;c. and yet all is no harder then thy heart, nor yet ſo
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:113418:83"/>
hard. God doth not an action without us, but to ſuit it to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within us.</p>
               <p>This point may be uſefull reſpecting time to come, and the mercy you look for. You look for great things, but how are ye fitted for them? Chriſt doth fit one thing to another. Great things are already, but you priſe them not; the doores of Gods houſe are open, but you have no hearts to go in: the day of <hi>ſmall things is deſpiſed,</hi> and yet you expect great things. Iſrael expected milk and honey flowing, and yet could not eat the Manna that was about their tents, and did God give them their expectation? doth God give great ſpirituall mercy to full ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks? doth he ſatisfie the loathing ſoul? The Iſraelits were judged in the baſeneſſe of their hearts, and their bodies fell in a wilderneſſe. Juſt as they kept their ſouls, Do you not keep your ſouls in a wilderneſſe, out of the fellowſhip of the Goſpel, as the reſt of the world do? you will be judged where you lie; where your ſouls lie cold and dead, their ſhall your carcaſes fall and die. God is ſpuing out hovering ſpirits that are neither hot nor cold, but hot and then cold, that will and then will not obey Chriſt. Diſcreet ſtomacks, do not expect great feaſts, you muſt have a vomit firſt; you are bid to come into the feaſt, and you have excuſes, the high wayes and fields ſhall yield gueſts to Chriſt, and you ſhall die in your ſhame. The poore unknown parts of the world, poſſibly may poſſeſſe what Chriſt is now diſhing out.</p>
               <p>Simplicity fitteth for great things, God maketh ſuch a ſpirit, and then beſtoweth all upon it, the choyceſt ſpirituall favours. England thy miſery is double, were it but ſingle, thou mightſt ſoon recover. Thou haſt <hi>no knowledge of God,</hi> but this is not all, if it were, means might ſoon make this; but thou haſt <hi>no truth nor knowledge of God:</hi> there is no truth nor knowledge of God. Some ſpirits are wanton, and they know not what they would have; others proud, and this and that they muſt have: others politick, and they ſay, this we ſhould have, but not yet: who can expect brave things in the midſt of ſuch a baſe people. Chriſtians deceive not your ſelves with dreams, for God is not mocked, he will make you open your <hi>mouths wide,</hi> ere he give
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:113418:83"/>
great things; <hi>Open thy mouth wide and I will fill it,</hi> Pſal. 81.10. You purſe up your ſpirits, and wring and ſqueez your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſo that there is no capacitie for the reception of full ſoul-mercies. The new heaven will have a new earth, the holy land ſhall have a holy ſeed come into it. Can you cleanſe your ſelves from all your abominations? and can you do this ſpeedily? Then may you ſee the good of Gods choſen, but otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect as you are.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Judgement is clear, things are diſcerned as they are, where the heart is truly turned to God.

Chriſt is the loweſt amongſt men, but chiefeſt with God, and therefore ſo with the godly. This is wiſdome and all wiſdome.

Senſe carries you to call things as your palate reliſhes them, according to this you ſay, This is the ſweeteſt diſh at table. Love is divine in a divine heart, and as things riſe in the divinity of their nature, ſo divine affection calls them, and admires them.

Paul perſonates the godly here, they call Chriſt as they love him, as they find him in ſweetneſſe to their ſouls, in his words and works; none ſpeak like him to their ſouls, nor none does like him, and therefore they crown him and ſtyle him <hi>chief.</hi>

Who will ſhew us any good? ſome can call nothing good, but what is carnally good, trading is good, money is good, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe: no nothing elſe indeed, not the heart that ſayes ſo. Not Chriſt, but the bag was chief to Judas, though he heard ſo much, and ſaw ſo much of his worth, which ſpake him a child of perdition; there be more of theſe children in the world. You Londoners have heard much, and ſeen much of Chriſt, more I think then any city under heaven, and yet to many of you, your bags and your wealth (I fear) are dearer then the Lord Jeſus.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Three things ſpeak the undervaluing of Chriſt, truth neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſinne approv'd, Chriſt unbelieved. Light is to walk by, men ſleight this, and <hi>ſear their conſciences,</hi> truth is neglected, when not made a rule of life. Able diſcourſing ſpeaks not priſing of truth, but practiſing. Truth is made ſubordinate to ſelf ends, the plague is in the heart, love is not ſincere, Chriſt is not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed above the world. Many will not fully follow God, becauſe it will fully undo them: to follow truth as the world approves, is to prize Chriſt onely as the world doth. Fear your own hearts, ſnares are many within and without; Chriſt is indeed prized, when his will is obeyed. Action ſpeaks out affection, <hi>If you love me keep my commandments:</hi> if the heart be drawn, the foot will run; the crown wheel moving though but ſlowly, the little wheels run apace: the hand and the foot are but little wheels, in order to the heart, if this be drawn and moved though but a little, the other run. <hi>Draw me, and I will runne after thee. Draw me,</hi> that is, my heart, and then feet and all other parts ſhall come. Affection puts on to action; O how willing to obey is that ſoul that ſincerely loves! He would go, he would run, he would ride poſt to pleaſe God; no precept harſh where the heart is right. Chriſt made chief, and ſo is his will, above an Iſaac. <hi>By faith, Abraham when he was tried of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up Iſaac.</hi> God tried Abraham what was chief in his heart, himſelf or Iſaac, and Abraham gives open teſtimony of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in his action.</p>

Leſſening ſpeaks undervaluing, it doth ſo reſpecting precepts, and reſpecting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Unbelief makes great precepts no precepts, and it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth great promiſes no promiſes. It is the higheſt commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any diſh at Chriſts table, that you eat heartily of it, Chriſt accounts it ſo; it is the higheſt valuation of Chriſt, that you reſt upon him, that you take life at his hands, which he prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. Sinners, would you priſe Chriſt? be invited then unto, unto him, by what he proffers: he will pardon you, he will purge you, he will juſtifie, ſanctifie, glorifie you, if you believe on him. Faith is laying Chriſt in your boſome, and that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per priſing of a thing; faith is an heart act, a ſoul going out of every thing to God, wearied with every thing as defective, and fiting down in Chriſt as complete. Then do I priſe Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,

               <p>I cannot ſtand to ſpeak of particulars: I have but one thing to ſpeak in generall, and then I have done, and that is to all Gods people. You priſe Chriſt as chief, and ſo doth Chriſt you; Chriſt is your jewel, and you are Chriſts jewels; you make him your husband, and you are to him as a wife. They are bleſſed indeed, which have Chriſts prime love upon them: prime love gives out prime favours, you will be fed with the fineſt of the wheat, the fatted calf will be killed for you, the beſt robe will be brought for you, Benjamins double diſh, and double dainties will be ſet before you. Prime love works out into tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and tender mercy is mercy ſhaped to all your neceſſities, to keep you happy againſt all unhappineſſe. Some are but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly loved, yet they live well upon it, and are merry; you are dearly beloved of Chriſt, and yet you cannot live well upon this: No, I ſhall want my bread. Shall ravens be fed, and not dear children? will not a Father, a heavenly Father provide?</p>

               <p>This time is ſad, ſo is our text, it leads us to behold a world of dead men. <hi>From the dead,</hi> &amp;c. The term is indefinite, and ſpeaks our condition univerſally. We are all by ſinne dead, without power to pleaſe God, and liable to wrath for ever, and Chriſt the firſt that made way out of this condition, the firſt that broke through that diſpleaſure which ſpoild us all. Bodily death is ſad, ſoul-death a thouſand times more ſad: we muſt walk amongſt the tombes for an houre, we are to rip up the dead, to ſet out the nature of ſoul-death.</p>

               <p>Waters of life are given to ſwouning perſons, they that grone and are heavie loden with ſinne, and come to Chriſt they find eaſe, a ſpirit of life and joy.

Cor. 15.25. If you have many upon your back, 'tis very diſadvantageous in fight, you cannot ſo eaſily fetch them off all, but it is all one to Chriſt to have many behind him, as before him, thoſe that are upon his

               <p>Tremble, proud profane hearts, at the univerſality of Chriſts power, he will have the preheminence over you.

               <p>Let us all look about us and know our duty; truth, not men, muſt be our rule, and bleſſed are they that can receive this: love is bountifull, ſhe will give Chriſt all, ſhe <hi>ſeeks not her own,</hi> ſhe ſets Chriſt as high as God ſets him, whatever it coſt her. Affection muſt have judgement to guide it, or elſe men erre on the right hand; and judgement muſt have love to quicken it, and warm it, or elſe men erre on the left hand; good men will become very bad, and ſpeak and do againſt their conſcience, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:113418:90"/>
break their peace to keep a bubble whole, their honour with men and the like. I know not what hearts you have for Chriſt, I know what hearts we all ſhould have, to ſet Chriſt at this height my text ſpeaks of. Love muſt be very ſtrong, conſcience very tender, the heart very humble, grace very ſincere, to give Chriſt the preheminence in all things. Cold hearts, brawnie hearts, proud hearts, rotten hearts, your plague is great, you can never advance Chriſt to his preheminence, and look how farre you are below your duty, ſo farre below your bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Hearts that can give Chriſt the preheminence in all things, have a very bleſſed condition, Communion ſweet, diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons full, tranquility ſecure: When the ſtrong man rules, all is at peace: 'tis true of Chriſt, he ſmiles upon them which he leads, when he can rule all, and carrie all in the ſoul, there is ſweet peace. In the world ye ſhall have tribulation, but <hi>in me peace,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. If the heart can endure tribulation to let Chriſt reigne, if it can let men domineer as they will, to give Chriſt preheminence over it ſelf, there is ſweet peace in ſuch a ſtate: Chriſt keeps up the heart mightily, when name, and ſtate, and all things without are down, and under the feet of the men of this world. Chriſt doth triumph in his throne, let what warre will be without; and he makes warre within, when kept from thence.</p>
               <p>Communion is ſweet, and diſpenſations are full, when Chriſt hath an univerſall dominion. As we anoint, we are anointed; anoint Chriſt all over, not onely head but feet, and ſo he will do you. Love Chriſt much, and he will love you much, let John lay his head in Chriſts boſome, and Chriſt will lay his heart and his head too in Johns boſome. What parts! what a ſpirit of light and revelation had the Apoſtle John! as if Chriſt had left his head wholly in Johns breaſt! he fled for it, that Chriſt might have in all things the preheminence, and Chriſt flies after him, and gives him preheminence in gifts above thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands.</p>
               <p>Condition is ſecure, ſtanding is firm indeed, when Chriſt hath hold of all: when there is no ſand in the foundation but
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:113418:91"/>
all rock, then winds may blow, and ſtorms beat, and yet the building will ſtand. The apoſtacy of perſons now ſo common, ſprings from hence, that they give not up all to Chriſt, and give him a full dominion, and a full hold-faſt, they will let Chriſt hold but a little, and then he in juſtice lets go all, and then all that ſeemed good comes to nothing. Sinners, you cut your own throats, in that you give not Chriſt a univerſall command, you will not ſuffer him to out the ſtrong man quite, and therefore he returns with ſeven worſe ſpirits, and ſo your latter end is worſe then your beginning. Know what is your peace and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in theſe evil times, and obſerve it.</p>

God is abſolute, not any thing without him hath any thing above him, that is, ſomething which he hath not to engage him. Your felicity ſecular is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many, and you contrive favour for one another, becauſe you judge you ſhall need it of the ſame parties in another kind.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:113418:91"/>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Free motion is the nobleſt: bounty is propoſed, not merit. God will work no otherwiſe but freely, that every ones crown of kindneſſe may be admired as bounty, as grace in height, as ſomething wholly from heaven. <hi>Thou] haſt triumphed glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly,</hi> ſaith the Scripture; that is, our mercies are derived to us after an admirable manner, and are full of thy ſelf and of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe. If a crumb be given to a dog, 'tis bounty; but if the whole feaſt be given to him, what bounty is this? God doth ſomething that ſinne may appear ſinne: <hi>But ſinne that it might appear ſinne, &amp;c.</hi> So God doth ſomething that grace may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear grace, he diſpenſeth it altogether at his pleaſure, that this may altogether appear, and nothing of the creature.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Free motion is the ſureſt: wheels muſt be oyled ſtill, where motion is by inſtruments. If there be no motive, yet action go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on for mans welfare, where motion is free. The mercy of God in Chriſt, is called <hi>ſure mercy; ſure,</hi> becauſe free. What is purely free, is uncapable of ceſſation, from airie impediments. What God does with pleaſure and out of pleaſure, he never grows weary of, and thus he ſheweth mercy to man, which makes it ſure indeed, and laſting from generation to generation. God moveth ſurely towards man: we are ſuch creatures in our fallen ſtate, that we throw diſcouragement upon God every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for ever looking towards us more; we are ſo froward, ſo throwing off of love, and therefore God hath propoſed to himſelf, ſuch a principle to move from, as may hold on his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever he ſee in us, to wit, his <hi>pleaſure.</hi>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Free motion is the ſweeteſt: God moves in the takingeſt way that may be, to fallen man. You love to ſee one give ſmilingly, to give much goods and with much goodneſſe, to give with all the heart: ſo doth God. God gives all with all his heart; he makes every ſtep to you in bloud, and yet in delight; it pleaſes him to part with all to enrich you: What God puts upon you, he practiſeth himſelf: he bids you give liberally, and give chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, becauſe he loves it: ſo doth he give liberally, and chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to make his motion lovely and taking. All fulneſſe is put
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:113418:92"/>
in Chriſt, and it is put there with all pleaſure, and with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, which renders Chriſt very taking to man indeed. Large action with ſtraitened affection, is a comely body with an ill-favoured face, which is not ſo generally taking. Chriſt is ſet out to man <hi>all fair,</hi> filled with all excellencie, and this by a hand of love, which is <hi>duplex plenitudo,</hi> a double fulneſſe, as it were. It was two deliverances to David, that he was delivered from a principle of love, that he was delivered as one <hi>delighted in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He delivered me, becauſe [he delighted in me.</hi> Thus are we delivered by Chriſt, from a principle of pleaſure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell,</hi> for us empty creatures.</p>

Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding makes ſorrow unkind, we meaſure mercy by our own comprehenſion, which hath killed many. Sinners, take heed what thoughts you take up of the kindneſſe of God: God doth not come to ſhew great kindneſſe as you do with great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſſe, and upon hard terms. It joyeth God, and pleaſeth him to meet prodigalls to kiſſe them and cloth them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all unkindneſſe, undutifulneſſe, unnaturalneſſe. Guilt makes horrour, and horrour makes diſtraction; diſtracted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whip, and cut, and wound themſelves. Dolefull conditions would be pitied above, but ſinners have no pity to themſelves, to think ſo.

               <p>It is pleaſing to God to do good but 'tis not pleaſing to us to receive it; the devil is too hard for us all.

Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſouls, ſtirre up the grace of God, and believe the word of the Goſpel; you pleaſe your ſelves in the thought of your ſins, and in the ruine of your ſouls through unbelief; but God is nor

Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of free grace hath foure aggravations: 'Tis ingratitude: Bounty is ſleighted, Manna is light bread, the ſmiling face of God hath no luſtre. God puts out his hand, and the ſinner lifts up his heel, which is groſſe ingratitude. Love ſhould gain love; when God ſmiles, we ſhould ſmile upon him: when the King of glory comes, we ſhould open the everlaſting doores: our thankfulneſſe reſpecting divine favours, is the reception of them our ingratitude is the rejection of them. <hi>Iſrael would none of me.</hi> Free grace is the ſweeteſt diſh in wiſdomes houſe, preſented to make two merry together: <hi>'tis wine upon the lees, 'tis the fat of the kidneys of wheat,</hi> 'tis the fatted calf, and the beſt garment; 'tis the heart of God held out, 'tis the glory of heaven viſible, to gain hearts: what heart hath that man that is not taken with theſe! Unkindneſſe ſinks deep into ſweet ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, God is ſuch a ſpirit.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>'Tis rebellion to deny free grace. Now we are upon a ſtep higher, to beat unkind ſouls, then we were before. The harlot <hi>Rahab by faith received the ſpies, and periſhed not with the [re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels: with them that believed not,</hi> ſay you. Not to receive what God freely proffers, is rebellion: it is mans will fighting againſt Gods; the King of kings warred againſt within his own dominions: the King kept out from his own chair of ſtate, to wit, the ſoul. Shall not God dwell in his own? Will you keep him out of his purchaſe, that which he hath paid ſuch a dear rate for? The workings of our heart we obſerve not, we are undone by this careleſneſſe: who ſtrives within? and who is thruſt out? Is it Chriſt? or who is it? 'Twere worth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:113418:93"/>
to know who 'tis that is reſiſted by the ſoul now and then. Man through careleſneſſe continues a rebell againſt Chriſt, and knows it not: gain-ſayings of free grace, ſpeaks you all rebels, and ſo you are called by the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, as well as in the place forecited. Men and women, ſtudy your own hearts, and tell me how they move. It is pleaſing to God to embrace you: is it pleaſing to you to accept him? Why not now then? your rebellion will be written in heaven, if you turn off Chriſt from time to time. Rebellion hath its degrees, It is rebellion to abide in unbelief one houre. The land in which we live is divided, it is deadly to behold. The Kings ſide ſay we are rebells, the Parliaments ſide ſay that they are rebells: by ſuch an account we are all rebells; and truly that's my fear, that we are all rebells to Chriſt, and that this is the reaſon he makes no better uſe of us, but one to deſtroy another. It were well if ſpirituall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion were looked after betimes, 'twill end us all elſe. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall peace, and eternall truth are worth nothing; men tread underfoot the bloud of the Sonne of God, the grace by which they ſhould be ſaved, and take pleaſure in unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and no pleaſure in the good pleaſure of God, which is ready to ſave them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis groundleſſe wickedneſſe; to deny the free-grace of God. Some action hath reaſon, and then the creature can ſtand upon his defence. But ſinners, what reaſon have you for reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free-grace? You refuſe many things for coſt, you cannot refuſe free-grace upon this ground, you may have it for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. God doth cloath lillies and ſouls alike; though they do not ſpin, to make their own apparell, yet have moſt royall habit. Every one of Gods children are rich, but riſe to it out of nothing: they have clothing of the beſt, lodging of the beſt, feeding of the beſt, and all for nothing. None go ſo richly, none lodge ſo delightfully, none fare ſo daintily as thoſe that embrace the good pleaſure of God. Some things yield but a little of what you ſeek and expect, and therefore you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them; but you cannot reject free-grace upon this ground. Free love is full love, nothing is ſo full; it hath all fullneſſe in
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:113418:93"/>
it. <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould [all fulneſſe dwell.</hi> What thing of all the things which you are in love with, hath <hi>all fulneſſe</hi> in it? Things with which you are taken, have commonly but one excellency, and but a little of that. You love ſome for their wiſdome, and yet they have not all wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and all knowledge. You love others for their ſtrength and fortitude; and yet they have not all power, nor all might: yet ſo hath free grace, it hath all kinds of graces in it, and the complement of all theſe. The Sonne that ſmiles upon us, is all light, and <hi>in him is no darkneſſe.</hi> Ungracious hearts, think of this; it will be put home upon you, why you have no grace, why you have no wedding garment; when the great marriage day comes, you will preſently be eſpied, by one that will then view all: here's a man hath no grace. What's the reaſon? Could he have none? or would he have none? To one I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſaith God, he might have had grace and life, and it would have <hi>pleaſed me</hi> to have enriched him with theſe. To the other I will anſwer ſaith conſcience, This wretched ſoul would have no grace, he loved iniquity and hated righteouſneſſe, therefore is he here unrighteous; he thought himſelf rich and vvell cloathed, and therefore ſtands here novv poor and naked.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>'Tis remedileſſe wickedneſſe to deny free grace. The miſeries of man are many, and yet there is but one remedy. Free grace hath balm for every wound, which rejected, every wound is mortall: The leaſt ſinne is death. <hi>The wages of ſinne,</hi> that is, <hi>of every ſinne is death.</hi> For bodily diſtreſſes, there be many remedies, if men will not pitty me when I hunger, ravens may; If Chriſtians will not pitty when I am ſore, dogges may: but in ſoul diſtreſſes, there is but one remedy, to wit, what God will pleaſe to do; if God will pleaſe to do nothing for me, none elſe will or can. <hi>No eye pittied thee, to do any of theſe for thee.</hi> Gods eye pitileſſe, and there is no eye pittifull nor can be to the ſoul. 'Tis ſtoried of the balm, that it groweth in the Holy-land and no where elſe, which is the reaſon of that ſpeech, <hi>Is there no balm in Gilead?</hi> Mercy for your ſouls, is in the pleaſure of God, and no where elſe. Sinners make no more of the favour of God, then of the favour of man: I live not upon one; the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:113418:94"/>
heart layeth this concluſion and ſwelleth, and lifteth up the heel. Ah wretches, you cannot ſay ſo of God: you live upon one, yea upon one thing in God, upon the ſmiles of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, upon this that he is free in mercy, that it <hi>pleaſeth him to ſave ſouls.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This point hath been applyed to convince and humble, and it may alſo be applyed in the next place to chear and revive.

One hath much wiſedome, another much knowledge, another but a little of either, onely enough for a toe, to be carried and guided by a bigger and nobler member, and yet as much of the will of God in this as in the other. Windes, Seas, Planners, Brutes, Men, Perſons, Parts, Actions, all are carried about with one wheel, the will of God.</p>
               <p>Things above man are ſhaped alſo,<note place="margin">Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove man.</note> and ſquared according to the will of God. <hi>Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed, that did he in Heaven, in Earth, in the Sea, and in all deep places,</hi> Pſalme 35.6. <hi>Omnia quae voluit Deus,</hi> all things which the Lord <hi>willed,</hi> &amp;c. God hath no other counſellour but his Will about all buſineſſe; buſineſſes here below, and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes above in Heaven. God moveth to every thing in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as he pleaſeth, and maketh conveyance thence of things as he pleaſeth: God hath many about him, and when he hath any buſineſſe to diſpatch here below, he maketh a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger to man, of whom he will, and wrappeth up what good he will, and ſendeth it along with him. The word goeth forth out of Heaven for the ſouls of men, from divine will: This wind bloweth <hi>where he liſteth, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching,</hi> &amp;c. The Spirit goeth forth out of Heaven by the will of God.</p>
               <p>Chriſt goeth forth from Gods will, and all that he bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: Gods will guideth him to ſend whom he will, and what he will with him, from Heaven to Earth. It pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſend Chriſt out of his boſome, and with him all fulneſſe from Heaven to Earth. All runneth into this, that God ſhapeth every thing to man according to his will.</p>

Perſecuting bloudy wretches, is your will abſolute? May your will be an infallible rule to you, as Gods is? Are ye men? or are ye Gods? or are ye Devils? Will you do what you will? Is it a ſmall thing to you to deſtroy divine prerogative, to ſtep up into the chair of State, to ſlaſh and cut Truth and the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of it, with your tongues, and pens, and hands, as you will? Malice broke out, hypocriſie ſtriveth to hide it, men would not have their inſides outward, but God giveth up man to his will, and then the heart is plainly ſeen: Reſolution to evill, is the puniſhment of hypocriſie: obſerve theſe times, and you ſhall ſee men ſpeak out themſelves, and write down in red letters, what they are.</p>
               <p>A man faſt to his will, was firſt very looſe from God.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> A man pinn'd to his will, hath three grand plagues upon him. One is this, whatever he doth amiſſe is aggravated ſtill: thou didſt it wilfully. Chriſt bleeds, truth bleeds, conſcience bleeds, and all theſe take their bloud, and throw it in the face of this ſinner, with this anguiſh, Ah wretch, <hi>thou gavest us theſe wounds with thy will,</hi> thou haſt committed wilfull murther: we preached unto thee, we prayed unto thee, we cried and wept unto thee, to ſave our bloud, yet thou wouldeſt not. O how is Jeruſalems ſinne aggravated, from their will! I would have gathered thee, <hi>but thou wouldeſt not.</hi> I ſpake words to thee, ſhed tears to thee, to ſave my bloud, to love my perſon, and yet <hi>thou wouldeſt not.</hi> 'Tis made ſelf-murther in the Scripture, which is the bloudieſt murther of all, ſo highly is ſelf-will ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated. <hi>O Iſrael thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf.</hi> 'Tis all one as if God had ſaid, thou haſt been ſelf-willed. A man may fall off, and yet have his honour with Chriſt, if will move well; no ſinne is aggravated, but all extenuated, alas, the <hi>fleſh is weak!</hi> But 'tis enough to me ſaith Chriſt, that the <hi>ſpirit is willing.</hi> Bigge-ſpirited ſinners, think of this, you ſinne no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but bigge ſinnes; the letters you make are ſuitable to the penne with which you write them, 'tis a text penne you write with, and they are all text letters which you make, and Chriſt will ſhew you them in his book hereafter, and they will be very plain to be read, by men, Angels, and conſcience, they are ſo bigge. Aggravation is a willfull ſinners plague, he ſinnes nothing but bigge ſinnes, all his brats are clothed in ſcarlet, which ſpeaks very loud to conſcience.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Conviction is a ſecond plague, of a wilfull ſinner; this is all his gratulation from Chriſt, fire thrown in his face. When ever Chriſt meets a wilfull ſinner,, he draws his ſword at him, ſlaſhes conſcience, and wounds it deeply. This ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner comes to Church, and there Chriſt meets him, and ſtabbes him to the heart, with every word he ſpeaks, which is the ſword of the ſpirit; this ſinner goes into company more ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, and yet there too, Chriſt meets him and throws dirt in his face, the filth of his action whilſt hot, that it may be the more ſcalding; in the midſt of laughter, nips him by
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:113418:97"/>
the heart. Whileſt the Saints are before the wicked, and the bloud of their names upon their tongues, ſporting themſelves, he makes them tremble as he did Felix. Bigge veſſels that are high above water, are eaſily ſhot through and through: 'tis the uſuall practiſe of God, to make <hi>Paſhurs Magor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſabib,</hi> to ſhoot them through and through, to ſmite ſuch within, as ſmite his without, and to make them <hi>fear round about.</hi> None in ſtronger terrour at times, then ſtout-hearted ſinners. This makes vexation, which is our next thing to purſue.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Devils are tormented, 'tis their proper plague; 'tis the proper plague of a man pinned to his will, to be ſtill croſſed and vexed, God doth what he can, and another doth what he can to pleaſe him, yet nothing goeth right, his will is ſo crooked and perverſe, and this makes him mad, and this is Gods way of whipping his bedlams, thoſe that are out of their wits, againſt truth and holineſſe. One calls for mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the other brings ſtones, the proud Babel will not up: did not that vex and torture them, think you? The great God and great-ſpirited men meet ſometimes, and they juſtle and he juſtles, and crouds their limbs againſt the wall, and that maddes them to the heart. Fruſtration of intention, and diſproſperity of action, you cannot find out a worſe hell for a proud man, and yet thus God dealeth uſually with ſuch ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. God oppoſeth will to will, and what men ſay ſhall be, God ſaith it ſhall not be: he ſets himſelf to walk <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to them,</hi> which walk contrary to him, and this makes weeping and gnaſhing of teeth indeed, amongſt wilfull wretches. Can you imagine how this ſcourges wretches on the kings ſide, that God croſſes their will in all things? David pleaſed not Saul, Jonathan pleaſed not Saul, God plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not Saul, becauſe none pleaſed his will, this was an evil ſpirit vexing him continually. 'Tis the portion of all ſpirits more or leſſe, which are pinned to their will, they are vexed with an evill ſpirit of diſcontent perpetually. Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all raging enrageth God, and then he reveals his will, and then devils deſcend to hell, which is their place: all fiery ſpirits are put in a room together.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:113418:97"/>Let wilfull wretches ſtoop to the will of God, which is the uſe that Solomon makes of this point. <hi>Stand not in an evil thing, for he doth whatſoever pleaſeth him.</hi> Eccleſ. 8.3. He ſpeaks it in regard of the king, how much more true is it of the King of kings. That we do evil is not ſimply damnable, but that we ſtand in it. There muſt be but one God, one to rule by will; when we make more, then we pay for it. As God makes his will his rule in all things, ſo do you make his will your rule in all things, and not your own. Mine own heart is deceitfull, 'tis an ill guide. Sathan can get favour in every court here below, not a heart upon earth, but he finds ſomething in it, when he comes to welcome him; 'tis dangerous to make this generall commander of a mans military life in this world, which holds ſuch corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondencie, with ſuch a deadly enemy. O that men would thus wiſely conſider their way, and do like diſciples of Chriſt that have denied themſelves, and not like heady perſons, that have ſould themſelves to do wickedly. Poore creatures think that there is but one ſtep to felicitie, and that is to have their will in this thing or that. O if I had this or if I had that, what a bleſſed creature ſhould I be! whereas our felicity is not in having our own will from God, but in Gods having his own will from us; our bleſſedneſſe is not in our ſelves, but in him; not in any thing that we propoſe, but in what he propoſeth. 'Tis our meat and drink to do Gods will. 'Tis our felicity to riſe dayly to the life of Chriſt, who pleaſeth not himſelf. <hi>For even Chriſt pleaſeth not himſelf, but as it is written, the reproches of them that reproched thee, fell on me,</hi> Romans 15.3.</p>
               <p>A word of conſolation, and I have done. Some favours are long a coming, and then we are ſad: it ſhould not be, for they come as ſoon as God will, and ſooner would not be well for us. Some perſons are very bitter in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, this makes others concerned therein, to weep bitterly: it ſhould not be, no creature is bitterer to me then God will; the cup of gall and vinegar in Chriſts hand, is Gods will. <hi>Father thy will be done.</hi> Men are ſtrong, devils are ſtrong,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:113418:98"/>
luſts are ſtrong, and I think they ſhall never down, and this throws me down: but it ſhould not be, for though I cannot throw theſe down, God will; he wills the death of ſinners, when paſt remedie; and he wills the death of ſinnes, when paſt our ſtrength, and that he wills this is enough; I will be thou clean. That God ſhapes out every thing by his will, makes ill for ſinners, for wilful ſinners, but very well for ſuch as are humble and penitent.</p>

               <p>Gods motion is exemplary, you may ſafely make his ſpirit your pattern, and 'tis a bleſſed ſoule that can move as he doth.

               <p>The carriage of God ſhould be imitated, and the love of God ſhould be received, and admired; theſe are the laſt things that I will urge upon you.

The Crowner will ſit, the debt of love will be laid to our charge; If you love your ſoules, be as reſtleſſe to receive and admire, as God is to proffer. Mercie is our Manna, our bread from heaven, we ſhould feed upon it; every good thing comes downe from heaven, and ſhould lead our ſoules thither, and then 'tis good to us. You have not a crum of kindneſſe but comes from heaven; but love in ſtrength is heaven it ſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending. Who can but admire, and receive this? who can but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into heaven, when it comes to his dore? What will heaven be turned into, if turned off at our dore?</p>
               <p>Let ſinners tremble, ſuch as trample upon reſtleſſe love, and gag the mouth of continuall crying mercy, but let weake hearts cheare themſelves: 'tis a delightfull thing to God, to receive you; he is reſtleſſe, and will be reſtleſſe, till you have reſt. Broken hearts can make nothing hold together, to doe them good: with cords of love, they hang themſelves. When mercy in latitude is mentioned, 'tis turned off: God hath no heart to me; why? I miſ-pend and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe all. Why, yet thou <hi>art invited to eate that which is good, and to let thy ſoule delight it ſelfe in fatneſſe.</hi> And God is reſtleſſe in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation; he eyes not what you have neglected, no nor what you have abuſed; he eyes your neceſſitie, and his owne grace; and it would delight him much, if you would now eate that which is good, <hi>and let your ſoules delight themſelves in fatneſſe,</hi> Eſa. 45.2. God is not pleaſed that I ſinne, but he is pleaſed that I believe, let my ſin be what it will, dying hearts fetch life from this Text, that it pleaſeth God to give Chriſt for you.</p>

Wee are vaſter in thoughts, then wee can be in words or workes; 'tis not ſo with God, he is as profound in expreſſion, as in conception, and in action as in either; admirable great and deep in both. <hi>How great are thy workes, and thy thoughts very deep.</hi> The depth of divine expreſſion in action, we are now to fathome, <hi>fulneſſe, all fulneſſe:</hi> The worke is above us, but God will be mercifull to weakneſſe, if wee loſe our ſelves in him. If we can but admire thoughts, words, and workes, of bottomleſſe depth, as <hi>David</hi> did, and as the Apoſtle here doth, wee ſhall doe ſomething on-ward of our dutie, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the footſteps of the flocke. <hi>For it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Man is a creature, rather induced, then forced; as things are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed, ſo they draw. What hath much, moves a little; what hath very much, moves a little more; what hath all, fetches oft ſome from all, to imbrace this: this propertie onely hath Chriſt, he hath <hi>all fulneſſe.</hi> The expreſſion ſpeakes admirable perfection, reception, and fruition unto the higheſt bleſſedneſſe; which that Chriſt hath, I will demonſtrate to you, that I may purſue the ſcope of the holy Ghoſt, and gaine you all, if it may be, to love him.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Communication in relation to Chriſt is immediate; water at the Well-head, is pureſt, plentifulleſt, ſweeteſt. At the Well-head, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is for qualitie and quantitie full, one cannot ſo eaſily be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there in either, one cannot drinke a ſpring dry: Chriſt lies in the boſome of the Father, he <hi>is in God;</hi> the Leviathan tumbles in the deepe; the heart of God is deepe, what is in this, Chriſt onely knowes; what he determins and meanes within himſelfe, Chriſt imparts and none elſe. <hi>What Chriſt ſeeth the Father doe, that doth he,</hi> Joh. 5.19. Chriſt is in word and action, the revelation of what was hid in God from the beginning of the world. The Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> when he would tell you what is the riches of Chriſt,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:113418:101"/>
ſaith, that it is immediate riches, ſomething that he hath, which all the world beſide hath not, ſomething that lies hid where none can come at but himſelfe, ſomething that is <hi>hid in God,</hi> Epheſ. 3.8, 9. You have many inſtructers, but Chriſt hath none; <hi>Who hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him? He dwels in light.</hi> Nothing is hid from Chriſt, not the things which are in Gods breaſt, for he lies there. Chriſt hath immediate communication, which is full, as full as God. Chriſt hath vaſt braines, for God is his head, and none elſe. <hi>I would have you know, that the head of every man is Chriſt, and the head of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is man, and the [head of Chriſt is God]</hi> 1 Cor. 11.3. that's a brave head-piece indeed. The like place is that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.23. <hi>And yee are Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods.</hi> Chriſt hath immediate reference to none but God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Communication in order to Chriſt is immediate, and it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall. All fulneſſe empties all into him. <hi>God is in Chriſt reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the world, &amp;c.</hi> Some things will hold much, but are not filled; nothing will hold all but Chriſt, and he hath actuall communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to his utmoſt capacitie. God is in Chriſt, doing what he doth in this world. There is <hi>communicatio eſſentiae,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which Chriſt and his Father are one. There be many things have God in them, but none as Chriſt hath, none have all God in them, none have ſo much of God, as that they can ſpeake and doe as God, and ſo as that without blaſphemy they may be called God; yet ſo may Chriſt, 'tis no blaſphemy to call Chriſt equall to God, to call him God. Chriſt is God, and moves as God. <hi>Whatſoever things the Father doth, theſe alſo doth the Sonne.</hi> There is a univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of communication, you ſee, to Chriſt. <hi>Whatſoever things the Father doth, &amp;c.</hi> Life is <hi>quid eſſentiale &amp; quid univerſale,</hi> it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends all. As the Father hath this in himſelfe, ſo hath he given to the Sonne. <hi>As the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sonne to have life in himſelfe,</hi> Joh. 5.26. There is a univerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie that lies ſcattered in many things, as well as compriſed in one, and if you heed this, this alſo is communicated to Chriſt. <hi>All the 'promiſes are in Chriſt, yea, and in him amen, (i.)</hi> they are fulfilled in him firſt, and then by him to all others.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Finally, Communication is exact. Chriſt is eſſentially and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentally the ſame with his Father, <hi>He is the expreſſe image of his perſon, and the brightneſſe of his glory.</hi> Chriſt hath the ſame life, and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:113418:102"/>
the ſame felicities of life; he hath the ſame meate, the ſame habite, and the ſame dwelling; one Sunne hath as many raies as tother, and riſeth as high as tother; they move both in one ſpheare, they dwell in the ſame houſe, they have the ſame traine and attendance; where one goes, tother goes. <hi>My Father and I will come and ſup with him.</hi> Chriſt and his Father ſup together, lodge together. <hi>Eſſe &amp; radiatum eſſe,</hi> is communicated; Glory is communicated, the very glory which God perſonally weares, is communicated to Chriſt. <hi>Glorifie me with thine [owne ſelfe] with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</hi> All Chriſts is Gods, and all Gods is Chriſts; <hi>All mine are thine, and thine are mine.</hi> The very glory that God weares himſelfe, the glory which he weares in heaven, that which he wore before all the world was, is Chriſts. <hi>Whatſoever is under the whole Heaven, is Chriſts,</hi> Job 41.11. Yea, whatſoever is above the whole Heaven, whatſoever is in Heaven, is Chriſts: glory is his; <hi>thine is the kingdome, power, and glory.</hi> What glory? Why, that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which is at the right hand of God; The choiceſt glory in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the Heaven of Heavens, is Chriſts, and at his diſpoſe.</p>

                  </label> What is ſo compleat, and yet not gaine the heart, ſpeakes that heart very naught; and yet this is very common; though Chriſt have all fulneſſe, yet emptie creatures care nothing for him. When coſt is liberally laid out, and when all laid out will bring nothing in againe, that's ſad: when all in ſtocke is out, and brings in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, this goes to the heart of God. I planted a goodly vine, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble plant, a right ſeede, and yet that trampled under foote, ſaid God. Fulneſſe runs out, Mens ciſternes are broken, ſo that fulneſſe can fill nothing; ſuch broken ciſternes muſt be mended, or elſe they will be broken to pieces. 'Tis wonderfull that Chriſt is ſo full, and we are ſo emptie; the fault is not in him, 'tis in us; it muſt be found out and laid to heart, it cannot goe well with us elſe. I muſt ſpeake to three ſorts of men, ſome have nothing, and ſome have but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, not one of a thouſand full, with the fulneſſe of Chriſt: all have their fault, and muſt be told on't.</p>
               <p>Some have no grace, nor no good nature; <hi>farre from righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> as the Prophet ſpeakes; full of pride, and full of malice: <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſpied it in his time, ſo doe I now. <hi>The heart of the ſonnes of men is full of evill and madneſſe,</hi> Eccleſ. 9.3. Men watch not their hearts, and they pleaſe themſelves in it, as loving eaſe, and are undone ere
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:113418:102"/>
they are aware. Evill is a growing thing, but when dunged a little by remiſneſſe, the heart will grow full of it preſently, and then the next ſtep is, <hi>madneſſe,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>full of evill and madneſſe.</hi> The heart full of evill, and the man grows mad to maintaine it, and to ſpread it. Alas for thee <hi>England!</hi> thou art in a ſad condition, full of mad-men, men whoſe hearts are full of evill, and mad to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it: men emptie their cheſts of gold, yea they emptie their veines of bloud, to fill their ſoules and lives full of wickedneſſe, which they love. The heart full of evill, cannot hide it ſelfe; the curſe of God is upon ſin in ſtrength, to cut off the ſinner that is white to Harveſt. Things will ſtruggle for life, though they die for it: full ſtreames have their adventitious occurrences, which make overflowings. Were you at <hi>Oxford,</hi> you would ſee ſpring-tides eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, hearts full of evill, and over-flowing, and running out at their mouth, in blaſphemies as blacke as hell. 'Twere well if ſuch a great plague were at ſuch a great diſtance from us as <hi>Oxford:</hi> but alas for us! <hi>Oxford</hi> is full, <hi>London</hi> is full, <hi>England</hi> is full, ſcarce a heart amongſt us but is full of evill, and mad to maintaine it. What will become of us all? Hearts are full of ſinne, God is full of wrath, the Land is full of bloud: Ah Lord! are we not in hell on earth? And yet emptie hearts conſider nothing.</p>
               <p>Deluſions deſtroy thouſands; men full of pride, their eyes are ſwelled out; till they feele much, they can ſee nothing amiſſe in their owne wayes. The Land is full of wrath; not a man of you almoſt, but full of diſtreſſe in one kinde or other, and what's this but Gods broad demonſtration, that your hearts and lives are full of ſin, yet can you ſee this? ſenſe is the firſt ſtep to remedie, where this is not, notwithſtanding all meanes, ruine not remedie is neere: ah <hi>England!</hi> I feare thy condition, but yet ſtill will pray: your hearts are full of ſin, your lives full of miſeries, are your eyes full of teares? O that my heart were full of grace; Chriſt <hi>fills the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Grace in fulneſs, is the felicitie of life, bend not after this heighth, and you cannot be fully happie. Set God his diſtance, and be but never ſo little, and he cannot kiſſe you: unleſſe you take him fully into your armes, he will be jealous of your love, and ſet you at a diſtance every day more then other, till he hath ſhaken you off for ever. Times ſquare mens courſe, yea mens grace; affection and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:113418:103"/>
action muſt riſe but ſo high, leſt it ſet all afire, names, ſtate, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; if love burne ſo ſtrong as ſome Miniſters would have it, 'twill burne us out of all. The Lord be mercifull to mens baſeneſſe, this earth will not beare us long elſe; hell will be full of ſuch ſoules, ere ſuch ſoules will be full of grace. Let times be what they will, truth muſt be purſued to the full, this fils the ſoule with grace; neglect this, and 'tis impoſſible your hearts ſhould be full of grace, how full ſoever you get your purſes of money. Great things in the world, cut the throats of men, they will rather have emptie ſpirits, then emptie purſes, leane ſoules, then leane cheekes. Ah Lord! how do the dead bury the dead in earth now! Fill one anothers mouths with earth! Little of the world muſt ſerve, if wee would be full of grace. This gold lies not in earth, but in Heaven, not in the world, but in truth; dig theſe mines throughly, and you will find all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and be filled with all the fulneſſe of God.</p>
               <p>Conſolation ſprings from this point; a word of this and I have done. Wee have ſaid much of Chriſts fulneſſe, and yet too little; Chriſtians, comfort your ſelves, 'tis all yours. Chriſt hath all, and is full, ſo have you in him; claime your proprietie, and comfort your ſelves with it, in all your diſtreſſes in this life; as <hi>Paul</hi> did; <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.18. <hi>I have all and am full,</hi> ſaith he, and yet had nothing in the world. The Apoſtle had Chriſt which hath all, heaven and earth:<note place="margin">Qui habet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bentem omnia, habet omnia.</note> He that hath Chriſt hath all, <hi>formally,</hi> or <hi>eminenter (i.)</hi> whatſoever is wanting in the creature at any time, Chriſt makes it up, ſo that the ſoul is ſtill full; full of content, full of joy, and that's a bleſſed life that cannot be made miſerable. Thou haſt no righteouſneſſe, but Chriſt hath enough, which is all thine if thou couldeſt ſee it. Thou canſt not pray, but Chriſt hath the art on't, for he is full of the Spirit, and he makes thy requeſts; thou haſt no ſpirituals, no corporals, but Chiſt hath all: and thou mayſt from hence, as the Apoſtle doth, conclude, <hi>that he will ſupply all thy wants,</hi> Phil. 4.19. Chriſt will do for you according to his <hi>riches,</hi> and that will amount to very much, to the ſupply of all your wants, let them be what they will. <hi>But now my God will ſupply all your wants according to [his riches in glory] by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> According to that all fulneſſe, which now Chriſt hath in glory, will he diſpence. Lord, how full! how rich! how bleſſed will all Saints be! I leave them to admire this, till I can ſpeak of it more.</p>

Sin is a gangrene, the bowels are gnawed, the plague of man is at his heart; health is beſt wealth; that's wealth indeed, that makes the ſoul well. Faculties fight, the Devill ſets them on, the heart cannot ſtill its own ſtirs; if God in this caſe do nothing within, the man is a poor creature for all his riches; a million of money cannot give a moments eaſe, the man wil be diſtracted in the midſt of abundance, and curſe his gold as an Idol god, and wiſh his bags his winding ſheet; things ill within, and nothing can be well without; but the ſpirit full of God, though the purſe be not full of money, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is bleſſed, and to be admired as poſſeſſing all: 'Twas Chriſts caſe, and is here admired by the Apoſtle: <hi>It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſſe dwell;</hi> without him he had nothing.</p>

Mercy, that runs only into the purſe, runs out again; but Mercy, that runs into the ſoule, abides there for ever. You value eſtates, not as things hazardous, but according to what is ſure.

Infatuation is a heavie ſtroake; there are more deadly blowes upon us, then wee are aware of: truth is trampled upon, and this lightly eſteemed, what judgement can be in men, to make judgement of perſons or wayes. <hi>O yee ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, underſtand wiſdome,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon;</hi> divine diſcretion is peculiar wiſdome, 'tis a thing by it ſelfe to diſcerne what true worth perſons and things have in them; and yet he that cannot doe this, will lay vipers in his boſom, and whet knives to cut his own throat: ſo haſt thou done, poore <hi>England,</hi> for a long time, which makes thee bleed now ſo long and ſo deadly.</p>

Godlineſſe is a myſtery: the kernell of Scriptures, of every word you heare, lies inward. Chriſts words, are ſpirit and life.

Not far off according to preſence, but far off according to affection. Man is a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Lord, and the Lord a hater of man. Affection oppoſite, and actions are oppoſite: God and man fight, they ſeek the life of one another: fleſhly luſts fight againſt the ſoule <hi>(i.)</hi> againſt God in the ſoul.

Reconciliation is that act of Chriſt, which takes off this deadly purſuite: Let not this ſoul die, I have died: Reconciliation ſpeaks compaſſion, compenſation, yea, advocation; one pleads when the Sinner by reaſon of guilt is ſpeechleſſe. If crime be crying, and muſt have blood, let my blood go for it, ſaith Chriſt. Reconciliation, 'tis Chriſt perſonating a ſinner and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a diſpleaſed God, till he be overcome, and think well of one whom he ſaid he would ruine. <hi>If we ſin, we have an advocate,</hi> &amp;c.

God carries a common reſpect to all; he makes the Sun to ſhine upon the good, and upon the bad; as a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor he upholds the whole world, which is great friendſhip, this ſpeaks not reconciliation. Reconciliation ſpeaks fatherly friendſhip. Gods motion is wonderfull, he comes very neer, or goes very far off every one: If he fall out, he kills; if he fall in, he marries: Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation ſpeaks conjugall love, two united, as Father and Son; yea, two united, as Husband and Wife. Chriſt perſonates a ſinner <hi>(i.)</hi> ſtands under his notion in point of ſin and wrath, and works both off, and then he priviledges a ſinner, he puts his own raiment upon him: The King ſets <hi>Moredeai</hi> upon his own horſe, and gives him royall apparel, makes him ſtand in his own relation, as a ſon. We are children and heirs <hi>[with Chriſt]:</hi> this ſpeaks reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, intire union and friendſhip. You fall out, and can never get ſo far in as you were; your hearts are naught: you are reconciled, yet remember ſomething, and for this keep your diſtance; God doth not ſo. Chriſt mediates, and ſin is put quite away, ſo that God remembers iniquity no more: the offender is laid where Chriſt is, in the boſome of God.

is not as humane, that works coldly, and reaches out but a little, leſt it ſhould over-do, and undo; divine friendſhip works freely, becauſe there is no feare of beggering the donor; all his care is, how to make the recipient receptive enough, rich enough. God at peace ſmiles, the rayes of this Sun, make a very rich Region; I cannot tell you the proſperity, that goes along with divine peace. Secular peace wraps up all ſecular good in't, divine peace wraps up all good, Secular and Celeſtiall. <hi>My peace I leave with you:</hi> Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation is a legacy, a legacie that hath all treaſure in it.

Satan is an accuſer of the brethren, but God hearkens to nothing which he ſaith. You cannot hearken to accuſation but it takes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and affection flattens, which is your weakneſſe. You have many enemies; one ſaith this of you, another that, and God hears all, and yet leſſens not love one whit, but heightens it.

Things here below ſmile, and your hearts are at reſt. No man is out with me, yet God may. Divine wrath works as divine love doth, not very viſibly. You cannot diſcern love, nor hatred, ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, by externals: You cannot tell, whether God be in or out with you, by the countenance of men, and the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of outward things. God can give great earthly things, when he is greatly diſpleaſed; he can give a King, in wrath; royall gifts, and yet rage. You may be kings, and yet God in wrath with you: men that have leaſt friendſhip with God, have many times moſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with the world, 'tis their portion. Do not loſe your ſouls in a ſnare; your table may be your ſnare; the things about you may be ordered to delude you. Some undo themſelves with what they have, others with what they want: Times are hard, friendſhip of the world needed, and they fall out with God, to get in with than; truth ſleighted to get favour with the world; Ah me! the man hath thrown off God; God will ſhift well enough for himſelf, but what will ſuch a ſoul do? This hard time is an affliction to hundreds, and a curſe to thouſands: Wretched hearts cannot tell what to do with themſelves in ſtraits, and therefore they will rather venture upon the diſpleaſure of God, then diſpleaſe a man, from whom they expect ſomething; ſuch buy a bubble deare, and it ſpeaks a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill ſtate: I am afraid ſuch have not taſted the bleſſedneſſe which I am upon, to wit, what the love and friendſhip of God is, they ſell it for ſo little.</p>
               <p>Perſons in with God, would not be out with him again for all the world. Blind conſciences can do much, ſleepy conſciences can do more, but ſeared conſciences can do any thing, and not be ſtirr'd; this ſpeaks not peace, not a reconciled ſtate: Reconciliation makes tender conſciences; 'tis too much that Chriſt was crucified once, I cannot crucifie him again. Sin is ſlain, the new man tender; ſome friends may fall out, and fight; but Chriſt and a reconciled ſoul can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: The heart cannot beare a diſagreement, after it's once recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God; much leſſe ſtrike a ſtroke againſt him. The ſoul bleeds a freſh when Chriſt doth, by any ones crucifying of him, much more, when it doth it it ſelf. Temptations tranſport, then a good man is not himſelf, ſuch caſes muſt be ſpoken to alone. Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation
<pb facs="tcp:113418:108"/>
makes a very tender union: Sinners view theſe times, they are very bloody; God is out with us certainly, how much doth it trouble you? Are you not the ſame men you were, in the ſame wayes you were? Can a man live in his ſins, and be at peace with God? Can a man be at peace with his luſts, and with his God? Securitie ſlayes us; nothing will breake our hearts, therefore God breakes our names, our ſtates, our bones. Wee flatter our ſelves, but riſe not to our dutie; men thus in with themſelves, are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out with God; 'tis <hi>Englands</hi> heavie plague, if it be any of yours here preſent, abaſe your ſelves. God ſpeakes peace to the contrite; if you cannot judge your ſelves, you will be judged, not juſtified of the Lord. Men that doat upon themſelves, are ſeldome cured of this plague till they die.</p>
               <p>God lookes not as man lookes; When you feaſt, he mournes. Victories ſpeake not God reconciled: What victories doe you ſee truth make upon mens luſts? Are not men as dead hearted, as ſtout-hearted, as rotten-hearted, as ever? The workes of God muſt be acknowledged, but not abuſed; you muſt have other things then this or that externall victory, to make a true medium to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate God reconciled to you. When juſtice kills bodies on one ſide, it may kill as many ſoules on tother ſide; wrath workes without and within. Lord, how many are hardened and fatned, by the bloud of others! Evill men underſtand not judgement, <hi>but they that ſeeke the Lord, underſtand all things,</hi> Pro. 28.5. A man had need pray over one act of providence a thouſand times, ere he venture to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it once; 'tis the higheſt wiſdome in the world, to underſtand the workes of God. The words of God are ambiguous, the workes of God are more ambiguous, yet compared they will illuſtrate one another; but few doe this at all, not one of a thouſand an artiſt this way, and hence 'tis that perſons and Kingdoms cry peace, peace, when there is no peace. Wee take up words and workes by rote, and ruine our ſelves and others. If all the Kings ſide were ſlaine, yet were we never the neerer peace with God, if wee continue to reſiſt his will; He hath many wayes to avenge the quarrell of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and to make all ſides know their owne. Nationall peace and perſonall peace, have one foundation, a through imbracing of Chriſt, as you ſee perſons or Kingdomes purſue or faulter herein, ſo feare or hope. <hi>He is our peace, which hath made two one, and broken

downe the wall of perdition.</hi> Chriſt is our peace; as we become one with him, we become one with God, and the creature. Chriſt and we two, God and we are two, God and we out, wee muſt needs be out with one another, and with all the creation.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is the knot that knits God and man together, faith is the bond that knits Chriſt and man together; ſome of you complaine that you have no peace, ſurely you have no faith. Broken bleeding hearts, remember who is your peace-maker, and how able he is at the worke. Chriſt is the Prince of peace: he commanded the Seas to be quiet, ſo he can command your conſciences, Chriſt hath balme at command, what ever the Father hath to refreſh, Chriſt hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his diſpoſe. God reſts in Chriſt; Infinite juſtice reſteth in him, therefore the ſoule cannot but much more finde reſt in him. <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom</hi> [I] <hi>reſt.</hi> Doth God himſelfe finde reſt in Chriſt concerning ſinne, whoſe puritie is ſo exact? And canſt not thou? God can object nothing, but Chriſt anſwers it: and canſt thou <hi>non-plus Chriſt?</hi> Satan is a ſophiſter; temptation abuſeth trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſpirits, ſuch cannot ſee neither the ſufficiency, nor the willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt to ſettle their condition. 'Tis a trouble to Chriſt, that you bleed ſo inwardly; he would have but one bleed; his bowels turne and beat within him, to ſee your wounds raw and open; he would bind them up, and powre oyle into them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry your ſoules to his lodging, and lay them in the breaſt of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and your Father, where is reſt indeed, and you will not. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is either virtually, or actually conſidered: the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our peace between Chriſt and the Father, was laid a great while agoe, but actually finiſhed between Chriſt and us, when wee believe: the firſt act doth ingage to the ſecond, that God is at peace with Chriſt, O troubled ſoules, 'tis an aſſurance that he will be at peace with you, and you ſhould plead it, and build upon it.</p>

The nobleſt life, dies: Sin hath brought death over all, over Chriſt. Felicitie at firſt was fixed; no mercy <hi>Adam</hi> had, died; tranſgreſſion hath made mutation, this is the worme that lies at the roote, and gnawes and killes the greeneſt and pleaſanteſt Goard that growes over us here. The ſin of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> hath ſucked the bloud of the ſecond, and not onely his bloud, but the bloud of all things elſe.

it in the world. <hi>Saul</hi> ſlew his thouſands, and <hi>David</hi> his ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, but ſin hath ſlaine its millions, hath wounded every thing to the heart, Chriſt not excepted, he together with all the creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on groanes, bleeds, dies; Some things are venemous and deadly within ſuch a limited compaſſe, the deſtructive propertie of ſin is univerſall, it poyſons and killes all the world over; it changes times, ſeaſons, Kingdomes, worlds; hath ſwept one world away, and 'twill ſweepe another world away.

               <p>Sin hath its influence into the mutation of things; ſo hath the will of God. Mutation ſpeakes affliction,<note place="margin">Will of God.</note> affliction ſprings not out of the duſt, but from the will of God: God ſets one thing againſt another, and makes fighting between creature and creature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man unto death. <hi>I ſet all men every one againſt his neighbour,</hi> Zach. 8.9, 10. <hi>I ſet all men, &amp;c.</hi> That there were men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt, and took away his life; that there were ſuch men againſt Chriſt, neighbours, one in his owne familie, &amp;c. God ſet them againſt him. <hi>Chriſt was delivered by the determinate counſell of God.</hi> Things are ſet their courſe; divine determination, byaſſeth every ſtate to ſuch an end: conditions can be no otherwiſe then they are. <hi>Knowne to the Lord are all his workes from the beginning.</hi> The age of a man is ſet; the age of the world is ſet; <hi>it ſhall be an hundred and twentie yeares,</hi> ſaith God. Sin provokes, juſtice decrees, this makes condition vary neceſſarily: every thing ſhall die, rather then divine juſtice; this overturnes all, to keepe up it ſelfe, Angels, men, the world, he which is greater and better then the world, Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The will of God, the wiſdome of God,<note place="margin">Wiſdome of God.</note> hath its influence into the mutation of things here below. The being of all things is ſuch, that no man may be ſecure. Mutation moulds up time into oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunitie, and duty preſſes hard upon a mans ſpirit, under ſuch a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it did upon Chriſt. I have but <hi>a day to worke in,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, things will change quickly, <hi>night will come,</hi> and then there will be no opportunitie to worke. If Chriſt made uſe of motive from the changeableneſſe of his condition, fallen man may much more. God is wiſe, condition is ſquared to quicken dutie. God would
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:113418:110"/>
have any thing die, rather then your grace. Were nothing dying, holy action would not be lively. Man is confident; if not powred out from veſſel to veſſel, he ſettles upon his lees. <hi>Becauſe they have no changes, therefore they feare not God,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt. Fallen man is purſued in his own way, to wit, with the falling of things; now one thing crackes, and anon another thing crackes, and theſe all eccho to one another, and ſpeake joyntly and lowdly to the ſoule, that all will crack anon and fall. Wherefore looke about thee ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not a thing, not a perſon comes into thy boſome, but breakes there, to breake the heart. You mourne at the funerall of things; groanes beget groanes. The bloud and death of things, when that cryes and preaches to us, if there be any grace, if there be any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the heart cannot but ſtirre. Wiſdome hath ordered every thing, to preach it ſelfe to death to you; plants, brutes, men; the choiceſt man that ever was, that ever came into the world, went out of it againe in his bloud, to move, and ſo to ſave the world. <hi>Having made peace by the bloud of his Croſſe.</hi> All runs into this, <hi>All conditions here below have mutation.</hi>

                  </label> This point preaches ſubmiſſion. It hath been a long time of giving, and receiving, now 'tis a time of taking away, and peoples hearts riſe at it. God is diſhonoured much by diſcontentedneſſe. Had we ſaid nothing to prove the point; <hi>that all things here below are mutable,</hi> the times in which wee live are a ſad demonſtration of it. View how like himſelfe God ſtill moves, this ſhall be our uſe of the point. What condition but is full of mutation? Brave eſtates, brave Kingdomes bleeding to death, and brought almoſt to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; our ſin is ripe, wrath is gone forth, <hi>England</hi> that was as the Queen of Nations for all fulneſſe, is waſting to nothing. Natives that for a while have left us, and now return'd to viſite us, ſcarce know their mother-Land, her face which looked ſo pleaſantly, is now ſo beſmeared with bloud. Here was the ſeat of my anceſtors, but 'tis burned; there had I brave and ſweet kindred, but now they are ſlaine; and thoſe that live, wiſh for death, becauſe nothing left to live upon. Wee had treaſure as the flints of the brooke, eſtate to accompliſh any thing, but now we faint in every undertaking, for want of ſilver-ſinewes. Wee had many callings, as ſo many ſeverall ornaments and pillars of ſtate, now all is turned into one, all grave-makers one for another, every one with his ſpade by his
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:113418:110"/>
ſide, to dig into the heart of his brother, to dig out a ſubſiſtence. Light was little, but love was much; truth could not be found, but if it could, O how ſweet (ſaid wee) ſhould it be to us, dearer then all? Truth now ſhines in our conſciences, and we care not for it: Ah Lord! this is the ſaddeſt change of all. The living are dead; the ſoul-living are ſlaine, with an evill time. Gods vowes were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, but now throwne off, and becauſe the times will not beare them. Outward changes are bad, but inward changes are farre worſe. <hi>England,</hi> where are thoſe flames of love, which blazed ſo gloriouſly a few yeares agoe? Brethren in <hi>New-England,</hi> were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: O that we had <hi>Ilium</hi> in <hi>Italium, New-England</hi> in old. Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>Holland</hi> were precious: O that wee had them againe, and the mercies which there they injoy, and now they are with us, they are trampled upon as the dirt, and all their paines to hold forth Chriſt and truth to us. Are not theſe ſad changes? <hi>Englands</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, inſide, all changed; from vertue to ſin, from love to malice, from wrath to bloud, and thus lies weltring, and no eye pities her, neither Gods eye, nor her own. <hi>Is this Naomi?</hi> 'Twas <hi>Naomies</hi> friends ſpeech to her; her condition was ſo altered, that they knew her not. Is this pleaſant? O no, ſaith ſhee, call mee not pleaſant, call me <hi>Mara,</hi> bitterneſſe, for the Lord hath dealt very bitterly with me. So may I ſay now; Is this <hi>England?</hi> Pleaſant <hi>England?</hi> O no, call it <hi>Mara,</hi> bitterneſſe, for affection is turned into gall and worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, ſhee deales very bitterly with God and his people, and the Lord deales very bitterly with her.</p>
               <p>Contemplate truth ſadly fulfill'd, and then ſet your ſelves to draw inſtruction from it. Mutation preaches ſubmiſſion; Doth God give and take? bleſſe him, 'tis wis way: he doth ſo with Chriſt. God filled Chriſts veins with brave blood, and then drew it out all; he prepared him a body, and then deſtroy'd it; he gave him a being on earth, and then turn'd him into hell. Chriſts tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity was turned into the ſtrongeſt extremity; outſide and inſide changed: he that heard that ſweet voyce, <hi>This is my beloved Son,</hi> &amp;c. cryes <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> Condition varies, rich are made poor, whole are wounded; men cannot beare this, therefore the land is full of diſcontent. Sin multiplies and hightens it ſelf as miſery doth; if God be not very mercifull, 'twill make mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery laſt, till there be not a man of us left. We feel the rod, but
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:113418:111"/>
do not beare it; ſenſe ſtirs up paſſion, we rage, and this foments divine diſpleaſure; the heart liſtens not after Gods meaning in his dealing, to accompliſh that, and when is it likely that our calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will ceaſe? God makes changes without, to make changes within: he makes broken eſtates, to make broken hearts; he brings much to nothing, that he may make you contented with any thing, with <hi>mean things.</hi> There are many turnings in your heart, do you conſider them? No, God writes them out in your life, that you may: God takes a copy from within, for all that he does to us without. Mariners are cheerfull when toſſed, if their Ship be good, becauſe they know the nature of the ſeas. The Ark is very good which a Chriſtian ſails in, 'tis Chriſt: the things we meet with here, are common to men, much more common to holy men; toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, tempeſts, <hi>All men are partakers of theſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; Chriſtians therefore ſhould be cheerfull.</p>
               <p>Finally, the point in hand ſhould commend the life to come to us, and make us long much for it. <hi>Job</hi> from a toſſed ſtate here, falls a commending the ſtate of the dead: <hi>They that are in the grave, are at reſt,</hi> &amp;c. The earth is the grave of the body, heaven or hell will be the grave of the ſoul; they that are in heaven are at reſt. I pity the ſtate of men that live in their ſins, they are toſt and tumbled here, and will be worſe toſt and tumbled hereafter. Wicked men, you will never have reſt; <hi>there is no peace to you,</hi> none here, nor none hereafter. Godly hearts, be cheerfull, you ſhall have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition without all diſtraction, you ſhall be toſſed and tumbled no more. Labour and ſorrow the Scripture makes the <hi>proprium</hi> of this life, incident to it, as the ſparks flie upward; but there is no labour above, much leſſe ſorrow, leaſt of all greateſt ſorrow, which falls out by great changes. Every ones labour follows him, and they ſit ſtill above, and eat the fruit thereof, they ſolace themſelves, in the travell of their ſouls, as Chriſt doth; as for changes, they above know none, there are no miſty foggy dayes above, no clouds, no clapping in and out of the Sun, they are above thoſe regions which make ſuch mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of weather. Were one above thoſe impure regions of aire we breath in, and cloſe by the Sun, one ſhould have the ſtrong influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and glory of it alway, every day alike. Here we ſojourn, and God ſojourns; God is as a wayfaring man, that ſtays here but a night; but above we ſhall all dwell together, and no ſojourning to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:113418:111"/>
make alteration of condition. If there be any felicity here, 'tis to know that our miſery ſhall end: <hi>Lord let me know my [end] and the number of my dayes, how long I have to live,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

anſwerable firſt or laſt, what ever the tongue ſay. Some do worſe then they meant; a Chieverall heart ſtretches when reacht, further then thought of. Morality is too weak to reſiſt ſin, Divinity is too weak to reſiſt ſin, if it reach not the ſoul: A man is as the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that aſſaults him, that hath not the ſword of the Spirit in his ſpirit; if it be to kill, to kill cruelly, to crucifie Chriſt; if a mans heart be not crucified by his light, he will crucifie his Father, his Saviour, when temptation lies this way. Sin is ſo far from leſſening, that it heightens it ſelf by notionall light, accidentally, though not naturally. What light takes not hold of the heart, the heart can take hold of it, to make its own way the ſtronger by.

                  </label> This point is very uſefull, and very ſeaſonable. Count not your externall felicity very ſecure, nor your perſons free from barbariſm, becauſe you live amongſt profeſſors of Chriſtianity. The Word of God is a <hi>draught-net,</hi> it brings up of all ſorts, whole Chriſtians, half Chriſtians; a man almoſt a Chriſtian, will quite condemn you, and all out torture you, and yet waſh his hands as innocent of your blood. Truth may do much upon the tongue, yea, much upon the heart of your neighbour, and yet not enough to ſecure your skin, the lives next to him. <hi>Felix</hi> trembled, <hi>Pilate</hi> ſuffered much in his ſpirit, yet did they make Chriſt ſuffer much in his fleſh and Spirit. The Word is of much power upon conſcience, when of none at all upon affection; affrights ſometimes, but not reforms: an
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:113418:112"/>
affrighted heart recovers it ſelf, and becomes by ſo much the more reſolute and hardened to deſperate work. You that tremble un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our miniſtry now, you will recover many ſuch pangs, and be hard-hearted to our death, to our crucifixion, when times turn another way. Let no man promiſe himſelf immunity from any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, becauſe he lives where profeſſion is rife. The beſt hearts are oftentimes ſooneſt deceived; much goodneſſe is ready to truſt it ſelf, where there is but little, and receives a wound. A Lark hath but a bad eye, to diſcern a true Sun from a falſe; ſhe ſees a Sun in a glaſſe, and comes down to delight in it, and is enſnared. Sweet ſpirits know this time, you have a double diſadvantage now: You think all are good, becauſe they ſpeak well; you will be taken with a Sun in a glaſſe, enſnared with ſomething like a Sun. Integrity goes with an open breaſt, Hypocriſie makes advantage of this, and ſtabs to the heart: There was never more need of this caution.</p>
               <p>Some out of ſweetneſſe, others out of courage are over credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; <hi>Gedeliah</hi> loſt his life this way. <hi>England</hi> hath almoſt loſt its life, through over-much credulouſneſſe, but from whence our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity hath ſprung, I know not. We have had fair words, ſhews of goodneſſe, and would not heed reall badneſſe, and look to our ſelves. 'Twas told <hi>Gedeliah,</hi> again and again, that ſuch ſought his life; ſo 'thath been told us, again and again, that ſuch and ſuch have been falſe and baſe, and yet, becauſe they have been ſpecious for this and that, we have been incredulous, and ruiningly ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Courage degenerates into ſtupidity, when faith builds alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether upon fancy. Stupidity ſpeaks deſtruction decreed; all is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd that ſhould prevent deſtruction. Underſtanding ſwallows fancies, judgement builds its welfare upon theſe; now the heart is aſleep amongſt Serpents: Write <hi>Lord have mercy</hi> upon this ſoule, he will certainly be ſtung to death, ere he awake. I have ſpoken <hi>Englands</hi> caſe ere I was aware: Stupidity is a common glague, our head is broke, our wounds are many, and we lay our bleeding ſtate in the boſome of ſuch as have ſerved the times, to fetch life in us again. Ah Lord! may it not make a tender heart ſhake, to ſee how much we lean upon many, that a little while ſince, bended any way? Where wealth and advantage abound, truſt may be ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous with leſſe perill, becauſe much will bear out a little loſſe, and do well; but when all is almoſt gone, then one muſt be double
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:113418:113"/>
wary how one truſts in weighty matter. This is our caſe, we are at laſt caſt, upon the brink of death and ruine, making our will in order to all priviledge, civill and divine, and yet have not that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Lord, to take double heed and care, whom we make executors, to whom we leave the hope of poſterity: We look at parts, honours, more then at truth of grace, in thoſe that manage our affaires; ſo there be but profeſſion and ſpecious pretences, ſome court divinity to paint perſons over, to look fair in the eye of men, and ſomething like the Cauſe we manage, we venture all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</p>

And it was but vain-glory; a vice, and no vertue; a ſtinking weed, and no flower.

Religion is lovely ſometimes, but not for it ſelfe; ſome take it up to drive deſignes, and can taſte ſweetneſſe in it no longer, then it will conduce to ſome ſecular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Chriſt is an abiding ſweet, where the heart is upright. Chriſt is deare upon the Croſſe; when torne to pieces deare; every limbe, every drop of his bloud, deare; ſo for ever. The way of Chriſt is more, then the ſtrewings of it, to a reall Chriſtian; all the wealth, and all the honour in the world, are not ſo pleaſant as one deſpiſed and perſecuted truth of Chriſt. <hi>They are joy'd in the way, they remember thee in thy wayes,</hi> Eſa. 64.5. They reſpect <hi>the way,</hi> not the ſtrewings of the way, no other ſtrewings but what Chriſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by his going before them. <hi>They remember [thee] in thy wayes, (i.)</hi> Chriſt; For he maketh his own wayes ſweet, to them that ſimply walke in them. Times vary oft, and all preſent new temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, yet one thing is conſtantly made at, in all where profeſſion is reall, <hi>(i)</hi> to injoy Chriſt: let my ſoule lie ſtill in the boſome of Chriſt, and move ſteadily in his wayes, and then let times and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes change as they will. Reall profeſſion purſues realitie in every condition; it hunts one hare, how many ſoever croſſe the way in which it goes. Diſtraction of times, naughtineſſe of men, make not Chriſt unpleaſant, but more precious. If the world will frowne, O that I could ſee Chriſt ſmile more. If truth be ſlighted, O that I could ſo walke, as to live ſome beautie into it: Integritie <hi>holds on her way,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith. I tremble to thinke of this generation, wee are clouds without water, carried as the winde ſits, that's <hi>Judes</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of naked profeſſion. When the <hi>Parliament</hi> prevailes, then their wayes are honoured; when the King prevailes, then his wayes are honour'd; when mens perſons are honour'd and proſper'd, then their religion is honour'd; meere profeſſion is a bable, a humour, any thing, nothing; a double minde, unſtable, a double mouth; ſweet and bitter from the ſame fountaine, as the ciſterne will beſt receive that is powred into: and this may be the motto of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of this time.</p>
               <p>All that hath been formerly ſaid, to diſtinguiſh in this matter, is but one thing, and may be plainly rendered thus; Naked profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is without internall reformation. Spirits can transforme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they can ſpeake like Angels, and yet abide Devils; men can doe much this way. <hi>Put yee on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> The tongue

The Temple was the ſame in the outſide in Chriſts time, that it was in the Prophets time before, yet he could not own it, becauſe the inſide was not the ſame, it had a <hi>den of theeves in it;</hi> My Temple hath a better inſide, ſaith he, and whips out theſe theeves, and overturnes their Tables: it ſhadowes out this, that where there is a reall Temple, a true Chriſtian, the power of all luſts, though never ſo many, is overturned in the ſoule by the power of Chriſt, which worketh in us.</p>
               <p>I will ſpeake no more by way of diſcovery, but let the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red lay to heart their condition. You which are but ſeeming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, you will be reall perſecutors. The puniſhment of one ſin, hardens to another. The proper plague of hypocriſie, is <hi>ſearing;</hi> burned ſpirits, are fit to burne others; ſo they doe in hell. 'Twas a generation of ſeared hypocrites, which contrived the bloud of Chriſt: are they not ſuch, many of them, which contrive Chriſts bloud and torment at this day, in the Chriſtian world? The croſſe wee beare is the wound of friends; the enemies which cut our throats, are of our owne houſe, of our owne Land, and pretend to be of our owne Religion. Would not that bloudy Army abroad, be accounted Proteſtants, and for Proteſtant Religion? <hi>I ſend you forth as lambes amongst wolves,</hi> and yet thoſe wolves wore ſheep-skins, they would be accounted of the ſeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> 'tis our caſe, and it makes our triall the greater; our burthen is heavie, but God is lightning it, glory be to his name. The axe is to the roote of the tree which bare but leaves, and they are cut downe apace. If this ſide would but mend, as faſt as tother ſide end, wee ſhould be a very bleſſed people quickly. The ripeſt fall firſt, we ſhall not hang long after, if our profeſſion alſo be found hypocriticall.</p>

Infinite Juſtice was offended, anſwerable diſpleaſure brake forth; a ſea of wrath in the world, and Chriſt in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of it alive, and all the waves paſſing over him. <hi>I went downe to the bottome of the mountaines,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jonah, All the waves paſſed over me, yet haſt thou brought my life the pit.</hi> Theſe expreſſions ſpeake Chriſt, he lay under mountaines, ſeas of diſpleaſure, he bore the full weight of divine wrath, he paid the utmoſt farthing. God is not extreame to marke what's done amiſſe, in reference to us, but he was ſo in reference to Chriſt; not a ſin, not a circumſtance of ſin overlooked, of all thoſe millions of ſinners and ſins undertaken for, but wrath weigh'd out exact in proportion to all, and laid on Chriſt, and he bore all. <hi>He bore the iniquitie of us all.</hi> Juſtice min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles

The ſtrength of ſin is the Law, and the ſtrength of the Law is the curſe, all the curſes written in Gods book, without any mercy mixed, and all this did Chriſt beare up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſſe. The croſſe was a grand curſe, a ſuperlative puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which wrapt up all the miſery in it, that ever juſtice made, or any creature felt. Chriſts cup had mixture in it, but not one ſweet ingredient, all corroding and ſpeaking full and pure wrath; gall and vineger was given him in the pangs of death:</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The bloud of the croſſe ſpeakes juſtice fully ſatisfied: 'tis called for this cauſe a <hi>Lutron,</hi> a ranſome. Wee were ſold under ſin, and the bloud of the croſſe bought us, paid the full demands of that power under which we were. <hi>The Son of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and give his life a ranſome for many.</hi> The bloud of the croſſe is a ranſome, that which gives full ſatisfaction to an offended God, under whoſe wrath wee lay. <hi>Wee are bought with a price,</hi> this price is not gold, nor ſilver, but the <hi>precious bloud of Chriſt.</hi> The bloud of Chriſt, is bloud of price, that this is ſhed, is as much as if the bloud of all the creatures in the world had been ſhed; yea more: life is our choiceſt jewel, yet all creatures lives put together, and put into one bundle of life, and preſented to God, he would not have taken it to ranſome one ſoule; no, he would not have taken it as ſatisfactory for one ſin. Juſtice offended is infinite, the price given for ſatisfaction muſt be proportionable, or elſe no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction: the bloud of all the world is finite, and not proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to infinite, and therefore <hi>God ſhed his bloud:</hi> the bloud of the croſſe, is the bloud of him that was God-man; this made the bloud of the humane nature <hi>precious bloud,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes; that is, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely precious, of worth to ſatisfie for all the ſins that are, or ſhall be committed in the world, becauſe all will riſe but to a finite bulke, let it ſwell as big as 'twill; 'tis of price to ſatisfie for all the ſinnes in the world, and if there were ſo many more then there are; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that expreſſion, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </label> Sinners, doe you conſider how uſefull Chriſt is, and make uſe of him? The chaſtiſement of our peace is upon him, that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to any mans eternall welfare, is contrived upon the croſſe by Chriſt; he hath bought all into his hand with his bloud, which tends to any ones good; he has the eare of God, the hand of God, the heart of God; he has Earth, Heaven, he hath eternall life, and can give it to whom he will; he hath the keyes of <hi>David,</hi> the keyes of thoſe everlaſting dores, he is the dore to the boſome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he hath by his bloud entered within the vaile, bought all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his cuſtodie. Chriſt is furniſhed to doe us good, and we make no uſe of him. Sinners tumble in their ſinnes, and fall aſleepe, and wrath cuts them off ere they dreame of a Saviour. There is a death in ſin, to which the death of Chriſt is without profit; this is when the ſoule will goe his own way. Many walke by no rule, all is fiſh that comes to net, all is contentfull, that ſutes to a carnall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: conſcience jogges theſe ſoules ſometimes, and then they talke of Chriſt, that he hath dyed for their ſinnes; but poore ſoules, they doe but talke. If the faith of ſuch perſons forementioned were faith
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:113418:116"/>
indeed, and no fancie, the ſoule would be crucified, with crucified Chriſt. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt.</hi> They which indeed appropriate the death of Chriſt, die with him in affection firſt, and then in action by little and little, according as the death of Chriſt is more and more beheld.</p>
               <p>The death of Chriſt is of double vertue, it makes a death of guilt, and a death of the very being of ſin. The bodie of ſin as well as the ſoule of ſin, is dead. <hi>The bodie is dead,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of corruption. Corruption keepes in a bodie, all that while 'tis alive: all powers combine to beate out their owne way, as will beſt carry the world afore it, and winke at, if not ſcoffe at the way of Chriſt; this ſoule crucifies Chriſt, but is not crucified with him. The ſin of this age is bloudy wickedneſſe, therefore doe we bleed. Surely, we bleed not ſo much for ſmall ſin; our ſin is crimſon and ſcarlet coloured; wee crucifie Chriſt, his truth, his people, therefore doth he crucifie us. Light riſes, ſo doth malice; 'tis nothing to the men of this generation, to ſpeak bitterly, to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bloudily, their own convictions; Chriſt ſhall die at the dore, rather then they will open love to him, to deſtroy the advantage of this time. A man crucified to Chriſt, is crucified to the world; you that kill not the luſts of the world, you kill Chriſt, but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, and his bloud ſhall be upon you, not to take off guilt, but to bind on guilt till you die, till bloud goe for bloud. 'Tis a very bloudy time in which we live, trials murther love to Chriſt, &amp; to one another; heartie affection to Chriſt can hardly be found, men are ſo taken up with their own ends. Povertie is marching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us like an armed man, all is falling; fleſh ſhakes at this, and treads upon Chriſt, and treads out his bowels, to keepe up; ſuch wretches as theſe, know not their wretched condition, they have not taſted of the bloud of Chriſt, nor know what Chriſt is now doing: Chriſt is now avenging the bloud of his Covenant, upon all that tread upon it; men that doe not ſo take hold of his bloud and death, as to bleed and die with him, in name, in ſtate, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhall bleed and die by him; this time is a diſcovery of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, and a recompence.</p>
               <p>Unſenſible perſons are below diſcipline, theſe therefore I muſt let goe. Where conſcience bleedes, the bloud of the croſſe may be of uſe; and to theſe in the laſt place I will addreſſe my ſelfe. Soules
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:113418:116"/>
are loaded and troubled about many things, but where the diſtreſſe is about eternall life, whether ſhall I live or die? Whether ſhall I live where Chriſt is or not? 'Twill be reliefe to ſuch a burthened heart to thinke, what Chriſt can doe for him in this caſe. Thou haſt a tender friend in Heaven, and thy ſoule is precious to Chriſt, he hath ſhed his bloud, that thou mighteſt not die, nor more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire. Things are very well between God and Chriſt, he hath ſtood in the perſon of many, and diſcharged well his undertaking: the favour of God is at his diſpoſe: whom he intercedes for with his bloud, eſcape the wrath of God. 'Tis ſad to me to ſee, how ſome ſoules ſinke, they thinke peace an impoſſible thing for them ever to attaine. What is not peace Chriſts? Is not Heaven Chriſts? Is not kingdome, power, and glory, Chriſts? That all is Chriſts, methinkes ſhould quiet the cryings of conſcience. That God is at peace with Chriſt, ſhould generate faith in the moſt complaingeſt ſoule. 'Tis a facile thing for Chriſt to procure the favour of God: but how ſhould one get Chriſts favour? And Chriſt is ſolicitous how to get thy favour. Chriſts favour comes farre eaſier to us, then Gods favour did to him; he doth not expect your bloud, to get his favour: to accept him, is to gaine him; his favour is free, all that he expects, is that poore ſoules would but truſt him, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him with their eſtates, that they would imploy him and none elſe, to procure the love of God, and eternall bleſſedneſſe.</p>
               <p>Could I truſt Chriſt with my eſtate, I know all would be well, but I cannot believe. Why, know this, that Chriſts bloud hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged God to give faith, and every grace elſe unto thee; what thou wouldeſt doe and canſt not, let not that deject, put out that grace you have. When a man cannot goe into the poole, 'tis hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to lie neere it, for one or other may take him up and carry him in thither, whither he cannot goe himſelfe. Pained ſoules, ſpeake of nothing but the bloud of Chriſt, prize nothing in compariſon of this; hence muſt come thy eaſe if ever: out of theſe pantings, ſpring faith unto joy. Chriſt takes up theſe creeples of a ſudden, and carries them into the poole of his bloud. You that have the Kings evill, ſtand in the way of the King, and though you cannot cure your ſelves, yet you will lie as faire for cure as you can. In a ſpirituall ſenſe, be thus prudent: in the middeſt of all your ſoule-paines, ſay, If ever any thing give me eaſe, it muſt be the bloud of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:113418:117"/>
Chriſt; if ever any thing quiet my conſcience, it muſt be Chriſts bloud ſprinkled upon it: out of theſe honourable thoughts of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per remedie, proceedes remedie to the ſoule.</p>
               <p>Matter of faith, and matter of love, ſhould ſpring from this point, if one had time to goe this way. The bloud of the croſſe ſpeakes love in ſtrength, love as ſtrong as death; what ſpeakes it in Chriſt, ſhould make it in us. No ſuch Sermon of love in the Bible, nor in the Creation, as the bloud of the Croſſe. Enlarge this your ſelves in deeds.</p>

               <p>DIvine friendſhip, according to its formalitie and cauſalitie I have handled; according to its extent, I am now to purſue it, to wit, how farre it reaches, which is noted in theſe laſt words; <hi>To things in earth, and to things in Heaven.</hi> This Scripture is difficult, yet other Scriptures compared with it, will helpe us to ſee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into it. <hi>By things in earth,</hi> is meant the Elect, called and uncalled. By <hi>things in Heaven,</hi> is meant Saints and Angels. By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling of all theſe to himſelfe, is meant the gathering of them all into one ſpirituall bodie, under one head the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by vertue of which the ſtate of fallen man is reſtored, the ſtate of bleſſed Angels confirmed, all to concenter in one common bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for ever; according to that <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.10. <hi>That in the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fulneſſe of time, he might gather together in one all things in Chriſt, which are in Heaven, and which are in earth.</hi> Gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, to <hi>renew the ſtate</hi> and condition of all, Angels and men, in and under <hi>one head,</hi> which is here mentioned Jeſus Chriſt. That Angels have the ſame common head with Saints, and ſo conſequently the completion of their ſtate in the ſame head, together with us, is apparent, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.10. <hi>And yee are compleat in him which is the head of all principalitie and power.</hi> Angels are of the quire above, together with the Saints, and they all ſing one tune; and they are of the fellowſhip below alſo, they are brought in as joynt members of the univerſall inviſible Church. <hi>You are come to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:113418:117"/>
mount Sion, to the Citie of the living God, to the heavenly Jeruſalem, and to an innumerable company of Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The condition of the greateſt ſtates, is here conſiderable: <hi>The nobleſt creatures are beholding to Chriſt,</hi> things in heaven as well as things in earth. Nothing is abſolute but God: men are noble, Angels are noble, but they all lean upon one more noble then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or elſe they would fall and become as ignoble as thoſe curſed ſpirits below us. Man is a little lower then Angels, Angels a great deal lower then Chriſt; their being is founded in <hi>his</hi> greatneſſe, and is confirmed in his goodneſſe. That grace which is redemption to the lower world, is confirmation to the upper.</p>
               <p>There would be no place for pride, if this point were well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted. None apter to ſwell in ſpirit then man; man ſets us up externally a little, and then the Devill ſets us up internally much; few but ſwell and break eternally, when gotten high in the world. I wonder at it, were you as high as heaven, as high as Angels, yet were ye below Chriſt. <hi>The body of Heaven in its brightneſſe, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his feet,</hi> Exod. 24.10. What is under Chriſts feet, he can trample upon at pleaſure; pride is no ſmall ſin, and yet it growes up (the Lord knows) from very ſmall things. What haſt thou that thou haſt not received? What have things in heaven, which they have not, and hold not from Chriſt?</p>
               <p>The leſſe may be ſaid for ſin, the greater 'tis, and the worſe that heart in which it growes. Pride is a grand plague, 'tis one that hath taken leave of Chriſt and conſcience, to humor himſelf; but Ah Lord, when will this man content himſelf! A man will ſooner breake his heart, then content his heart, which purſues the proud luſts of it. A ſoule devoted to it ſelf, is as cruell a Maſter to ſerve, as the Devill: to purſue the dictates of a proud ſpirit, is endleſſe work, and hell enough for any creature, if there were none elſe to come: Soules in this conſumption, ſhould conſider their diſeaſe, and their cure. The remedy of every vice is in Chriſt, this tree hath leaves to cure all diſeaſes. There is no diſtemper in the ſpirit, but Chriſt may be conſidered under ſuch a notion as to rectifie it. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Chriſt as the keeper up of Angels, and 'tis enough to keep down the ſpirit of any man.</p>

               <p>AS the expreſſion points at things in heaven, 'tis uſefull you ſee; as it ſpeaks of things in earth, 'tis more proper to us. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of divine love downward, is as large as upward; it reacheth <hi>all things in heaven,</hi> and <hi>all things in earth. That he might reconcile [all things] to himſelf, whether things in heaven, or things in earth.</hi> The grace of reconciliation, as it works towards things on earth, is very vaſt; as it works towards creatures above, 'tis unexpreſſible; a man cannot tell how many love ſmiles upon in heaven, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore generally expreſt, <hi>all things;</hi> a univerſall term, to note the vaſtneſſe of that kindneſſe: So as it works towards things on earth, 'tis inexpreſſible, 'tis called <hi>all things,</hi> to note the vaſtneſſe, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible company, which Chriſt embraceth here below.

                  </label> Grace doth abound, <hi>The Lord is upon many waters,</hi> Pſal. 29.3. As providence externall, ſo providence internall, doth reach forth it ſelf to many. Many bodies are ſaved from ſinking in the ſea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord is upon the waters: So many ſoules are ſaved from ſinking into hell, becauſe the Lord moves upon theſe <hi>many waters too.</hi> The world is full of troubles, as the ſea of waves, not one but meets with enough to over-turn all, if God did not uphold; the whole world would fall into a conſumption and die, as big a body as 'tis, if God did not uphold. Not one, nor two, nor three, but all creatures ſhare, in upholding mercy, or elſe all would ſink; 'tis ſo in a proportion in ſpirituall reſpects. Satan is an induſtrious creature, to overthrow mans welfare, he goes about, ſeeking whom he may devoure, none would eſcape hell, if God were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding rich in mercy; Satans deſire is to deſtroy all, and his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is attended with ſuch art, that it would certainly bring forth its end, did not the ſpeciall providence of Chriſt prevent; which it doth, and doth it to many, the grace of Chriſt unto life is powred out upon many ſouls. There are <hi>many laſt,</hi> which are made <hi>firſt,</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:113418:118"/>
as well as many <hi>firſt</hi> are made <hi>laſt.</hi> Many are eternally ſaved out of the power of Satan, as many are prey'd upon by him.</p>
               <p>Grace did work more compendiouſly then now it doth, before Chriſts coming in the fleſh; loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> found all that dropt from heaven, and they were but few, the Lord knoweth, <hi>one of a City, and two of a Tribe.</hi> But ſince, a great dore of love is opened, and many hundred ſoules in one City; yea, many thouſands in one Countrey, come in to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The white ſheet of mercy that is let down from Heaven now, <hi>is great,</hi> ſaith the Text, and it hath <hi>all manner of beaſts</hi> in it; and the Apoſtle makes a Comment upon it as I do. My viſion, ſaith he, ſpeaks the grace of Chriſt working now very richly; <hi>God hath ſhewed me that I ſhould call nothing common, or unclean.</hi> He ſpeaks it in the caſe of <hi>Saul;</hi> not a man ſo vile, ſo bloody and malicious, but the blood of Chriſt may reconcile him to God, the love of God doth now ſo richly work.</p>
               <p>Mercy is infinite, and it works ſo; God ſhews mercy to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, from generation to generation. <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed are as the ſtars of heaven for multitude: God hath but one Son, but Chriſt hath many; he brings <hi>many ſons to glory.</hi> Infinite mercy generates infinitely; what is in Chriſt, derives it ſelf to all the nations of the earth. <hi>Aarons</hi> rod buds, Chriſts bleſſing buds, it multiplies into many bleſſings, and ſpreads all the world over: <hi>In thee ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed.</hi> The Sun that ſhines upon us, ſhines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thouſands more, it caſteth over the world, and ſhines upon a world; ſo doth the Son of righteouſneſſe. God was in Chriſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciling <hi>a world</hi> to himſelf: the expreſſion notes quantity in ſome ſenſe, as well as quality, a world of worldly men.</p>

He whoſe hand is open to all, all mens mouths are open to ſpeak of his goodneſſe. Chriſt is a generall good, lame, blind, halt have favour; he keeps a table of kindneſſe for all commers, <hi>he reconciles all things.</hi> Love is deſtroyed, when the heart is not taken with great goodneſſe; love deſtroyed, there can be no marrying between Chriſt and the ſoul. 'Twas a great judgement, when their maids were not given to marry. There is no inclination to embrace Chriſt, when his beauty is no whit admired. Vanities deſtroy affection, ſome ſouls are ſots, talk of any
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:113418:119"/>
thing that is ſpirituall, and their hearts grow not amorous by it, but die within them, like <hi>Nabals;</hi> the curſe of God is in ſtrength here, theſe have made themſelves Eunuches for the kingdome of darkneſſe. Chriſt hath no engine to raiſe love like this, to wit, his bounty and ſweetneſſe, that he will give every one to drink that is dry; that <hi>Moſes</hi> a fair man will marry a <hi>Blackmoore;</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> will lodge a <hi>Lazarus</hi> in his boſome. If goodneſſe will not make good; if love will not draw love, let the ſoul marry whom he will, Chriſt will have none of him. Chriſt is noble, he will gain the heart fully, or he will marry no perſon in the world: Perſons ſhall be ſick of love, or they ſhall be unmarried to Chriſt. You care not whether perſons love you, ſo you can but get their wealth. Chriſt is righteous, he ſeeks us, not ours, perſons, not dowry: <hi>I ſeek not yours, but you.</hi> He was a friend to the Bride, which ſpake that, and ſpake his heart. I know not what hearts you have, nor how to wooe for my Maſters Son; I can ſay nothing but this, he is all love, he reconcileth all, high, low, rich, poore, heavenly things, earthly things, he takes duſt into his boſome, and delights in it for ever.</p>
               <p>The contemplation of Chriſts ſweetneſſe, makes the marriage knot, and the ſolace of the marriage when made. When is the ſoul in heaven? but when taken with that love which hath loved him, when conſidering love in its latitude: He hath <hi>loved me,</hi> and given himſelf <hi>for me;</hi> he reconciles all things indeed, that would not leave out <hi>me.</hi> Milk and honey is <hi>Canaan:</hi> As the ſoul feeds upon the riches of love, 'tis in heaven. Man is doubly miſerable, he is at a loſſe of ſatisfying ſolace, and of the right way to acquire it, he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with creatures, and when he comes to lie down in their boſome to ſolace, they vaniſh and vex; a man lies down ſmiling, riſeth up howling, becauſe that's nothing which he made ſo much; and this may be the Motto of all earthly beauties, <hi>That creature is nothing which man makes all.</hi> Taken with the love of Chriſt, and the longer ſo, the ſtronger ſo, the more bleſſed; the ſoul cannot want depth here, and tumble it ſelf aſhore, as it doth when it tumbles in other waters; ſweetneſſe in this way is found bottomleſſe. <hi>O the depth of the riches of the goodneſſe of God!</hi> &amp;c. 'Tis a brave thing to dive the depths of kindneſſe; if there be heaven any where, 'tis in the bottome of divine love. Things have their full ſolace in their proper element,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:113418:119"/>
this in reference to the ſoul of man, is the love of God, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof. What did take up <hi>Adams</hi> ſoul into Paradiſe, whileſt he moved well, but the beauty of God, the extent of his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that it reached all that <hi>Adam</hi> could look upon? and all that while had he Paradiſe in his ſpirit; but when he began to admire the beauty of forbidden things, the beauty of Diabolicall fancies, then he dyed in his neſt preſently. What takes up thoſe bleſſed ſpirits above, but the contemplation of the love of God? Here lies their full and perpetuall bleſſedneſſe, that they cannot nor will not look beſide love. 'Tis a very deſolate time in which we live, many have little left in the world to think upon, and yet ſet not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to think of that which might make all to them. Such are without ſolace indeed, which have none without nor within; how ſuch poor creatures bear up, I know not, how to keep them up if they ſink, I know not; there is no cordiall in any diſtreſſe, but the contemplation of the love of Chriſt, and under this notion, how large it is.</p>
               <p>This bleeding time makes my heart bleed, to think what refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to give forth to mourning perſons in every corner. State is gone, friends gone, all left me gone, this the complaint of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. Yet he that is all, is ready to receive you all, and to impart all to you. God hath ſet you free of this world, to think of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is better. Make uſe of the rich proffers of grace, and all will do well yet. What, doth Chriſt reconcile all things in earth to himſelf, and leave out me? Bleſſe me, even me alſo, O my Father, ſo pray. Some are froward, and will not ſtir after grace, though never ſo plentifull, though Chriſt will be friends with them, yet they will not with him: <hi>How oft would I have gathered thee, and thou wouldſt not?</hi> Take heed of ſtubbornneſſe in ſin, though Chriſt ſhew mercy to thouſands, yet he will be the death of ſuch a ſoul. I am affraid of ſome of you, leſt Satan ſhould harden your hearts againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Know the diſpoſition of grace; Chriſt treads upon none that ſtoop. Know the ſeaſon of grace; doth Chriſt knock? O then is the time when he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile thee to himſelf. Never let that word of Chriſt which takes thee, be forgotten; that's a kiſſe of Chriſts lips to gain thee; kiſſe the Son again. Bleſſe God, that he would make any word of his, a ſword to wound thy hard heart: Bleſſe Chriſt, that hee would
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:113418:120"/>
come ſo neer where thou dwelleſt, that he would not once knock, but put in his finger by the hole of the dore, to make thy bowels yearn after him: when he knocks again, intreat him to knock all down, that hinders his coming in. Longing ſouls after Chriſt, are the bleſſedſt ſouls in the world, who ever die unreconciled to God, they will not.</p>
               <p>This point will leave all men without excuſe, I will touch this, and conclude: God would have all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth, and Chriſt acts according to this lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; he reconciles all things to himſelf, he deſires not the death of one ſinner: Sinners, if you die in your ſins, blame your ſelves, not God, you will die as thoſe that exclude your ſelves, as thoſe that judge your ſelves unworthy of the Kingdome of God. Spirits deeply ingaged to their luſts, have deſperate reaſonings againſt free grace; when they can ſay nothing to ſtop the mouth of men and their conſcience, to keep on in their courſe, they alledge the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God; and if I be decreed to life, I ſhall do better one day, if not, all you ſay, or that I ſhall do, will do me no good. Ah, that ſo much of hell ſhould flame out of any mans mouth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth! What hath any ſoul to do with the Decree of God? Gods ſecret will doth not contradict his revealed. What latitude of love doth his revealed will hold forth? conſider that, and know, that God is reall. Doth he reconcile <hi>all things?</hi> then thou art bound to believe it, and to put in for a ſhare in that grace which is ſo large, which no ſoul ever did and miſſed.</p>

My ſin is ever before me, they are a load too heavie; this was not commended by God, though loved by a wounded ſpirit. There are two extreames, and both naught; bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken hearts ever thinke of their ſins, and hard hearts never; a ſtone as oft ſighes as they.

Man loves his fleſh, yea he loves his ſpirit; he doth not love to be bit in either, if he can tell how to ſhift it.

The demonſtration is this: to wit, an aptneſſe to run into the ſame ſin. Sin kindly called to minde, melts the heart; the heart melted, abhors its former courſe. <hi>Yea, what indignation, yea, what revenge!</hi> Where is this to be found now, againſt that barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and bloody ſin of burthening the conſcience with unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted things which was the ſin of Biſhops, and for which the Land now mourns. Are we not very apt to run into the ſame courſes? What is that which wee humbly ſeek for now in matters of Church-government, but divine warrant, and where this is not, that cuſtomes and courſes of our own may not be impoſed? and yet this accounted harſh and refractorineſſe by many, and perſons conſcienciouſly carried but at this height, conſtrued and trampled on at mens pleaſure, becauſe they can ſtoop to nothing but the will of Chriſt: Conſciences are of ſeverall conſtitutions; ſuch as are peeviſh muſt be pitied, not knocked in head; ſuch as are ingenuouſly tender, honoured; where neither of theſe can be found, that ſpirit is Prelaticall, and Lording over the conſcience, let it live in what breaſt it will. Now what pity, or what honour, tender conſciences find at this preſent in <hi>England,</hi> of all Lands, I leave to you to judge. Satan rages at us in many, God is good to us in a few, to bind him up, or we ſhould be buried alive again, thrown in priſons and dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons again, as bad as ever; mens tongues talk freely this way, which ſpeaks the heart, and what the hand ſhould be, if other things did concurre. How do mens fingers itch to be tearing our eſtates and fortunes, and whatſoever is dear, as formerly! Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt is ſet forth in the Scripture, under various ſhapes; alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of times neceſſitates him to change habite, to ſave his life and

               <p>If inclination to former ſins, make demonſtration of a ſinfull forgetting of ſin, reſolution to former courſes may much more; I beg that this may never gather about thy heart, O <hi>England,</hi> for death is in it: my heart bleeds for thee, when I conſider, with what violence thou goeſt in thine own way, but in this I ſpare thee yet, and ſpeak more of this to God upon my knees.</p>
               <p>Application hitherto hath been nationall, let every one turn it now, and make it perſonall. I was a blaſphemer, a perſecutor, ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from God by wicked works, but now I have obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. I doubt you cannot all ſay thus. Do you lay your condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion paſt and preſent to heart; and no ſmiting of breaſt; nor no change? it cannot be. What you were you are, and would be. Alas for ſuch ſouls! their condition is more miſerable then any, they have no mercy, nor care for none. The firſt ſtep to converſion, is to conſider what we have been, and are. <hi>I conſidered my wayes, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my feet unto thy teſtimonies.</hi> The prodigall <hi>came to himſelf,</hi> and then returned to his father. <hi>To himſelf</hi> (i.) to conſider what courſe he had led, what ſtate he was in, whither that way he was in did lead. Would ſinners would tread one ſtep in the way to life: What is the courſe I have led? What a man, or a woman have I been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto? A ſinners hand to the Devils Plough, he may look back, and do well; but Satan is againſt it: ſo is a mans own heart, yet ſomething muſt be done in this way againſt both, or the ſoul is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably loſt. Satan cannot endure that a man ſhould commune with his own heart, his wayes have no gloſſe at a view, he hath twenty wayes to prevent the danger of loſing a ſoul. What's paſt cannot be helped, what ſhouldeſt thou trouble thy ſelf to think upon't. God forgets thy ſin, and wilt not thou? Sinner, Satan is rocking thy ſoul now, if thou look not to it, thou will die in a ſlumber. God forgets our ſins, when we do remember them, and lay them upon Chriſt, not otherwiſe; when we examine our ſelves and judge our ſelves, and go out of our ſelves to Chriſt. <hi>If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe our ſin, God is mercifull to forgive:</hi> Many that had been thus and thus, ſaith the Text, <hi>came and confeſt their deeds, and then found mercy

from Chriſt.</hi> Chriſt will know what a man hath been out of his own mouth, ere he make him better. Chriſt will know what a man hath been, what a man is, and what he would be, and then goes to work hard indeed to make a miſerable creature, bleſſed.</p>
               <p>Take this Item, we can do nothing of our ſelves, the leaſt good is above us: to look back upon a bad life, 'tis of grace; as well as to reform a bad life. Creepies muſt take hold of ſomething when they would go: In our weakneſſe to duty, we muſt lean upon the Word of God. If you want a word to lean upon, I will give you one: <hi>And they that eſcape of you, ſhall remember me among the nations whither they ſhall be carried captives, becauſe I am broken with their whoriſh heart, and they ſhall loath themſelves, for the evills they have committed in all their abominations,</hi> Ezek. 6.9. 'Tis hard to finde a looking glaſſe to ſee ones life from one end to tother, yet Chriſt can help us to one, and he hath promiſed this and more, to make us look upon all our abominations, and to <hi>loath them and our ſelves for them;</hi> a ſoul got thus far, will grow in grace apace; no motive to the ſoul to grow kind to Chriſt, as to think well how unkind it hath been. What a hater, and then what a lover of Chriſt was <hi>Paul:</hi> To look back upon badneſſe, 'twill raiſe goodneſſe, when the heart is turned; O how oft have I kickt againſt Chriſt. How oft now ſhould I kiſſe him! How baſely did I tread him under foot, and how tenderly now ſhould I lay him in my boſome! <hi>Paul</hi> laboured more abundantly then they all. If you would be eminent for the ſtrength of love, and for the truth of love, look back.</p>

                  <hi>Alienation</hi> ſpeaks all miſery; man quite gone from God, and God quite gone from man; body and ſoul under the perpetuall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, of infinite wrath. God is all, or nothing to the creature, all favour, or nothing but diſpleaſure. Diſpleaſure orders every thing about a ſinfull State, as love orders all about a good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; poiſon is in every diſh at a ſinners Table, not a bit he eats, not a rag he wears, not a thing he does, but 'tis curſed from heaven: This is the proper expreſſion of alienation. <hi>The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, ſhall a nation which thou knoweſt not, eat up, and thou ſhalt be only oppreſſed, and cruſhed alway,</hi> Deut. 28.33. Theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſuit a ſtranger, he is one that is blaſted in all things, the divine hand of God doth <hi>only oppreſſe him</hi> (i.) only puniſh him, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cruſh and curſe him always.

               <p>
                  <hi>Alienation</hi> is a ſtate ſhut out from all divine privilege. Divine priviledges are of ſeverall ſorts, ſome ſignifie more favour then other: a man alienated from God, is cut off from all, he is none of the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> if he be called an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> if he be called a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> he is miſ-called. The proper title of an aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perſon, is a <hi>Heathen,</hi> a <hi>Publican,</hi> a <hi>Dog.</hi> A title is a ſmall thing, a ſhadow, yet God allows not this to ſome; an alienated perſon hath not the ſhadow of love, he may not call himſelf by the name of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he ſhall anſwer for this, that he bears the name of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> that he carries the name of the living, and is dead; that he calls himſelf <hi>homo,</hi> and is <hi>cadaver,</hi> a man, and is a carkaſſe. There be many things in the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> common and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, yet nothing ſo common as an alienated perſon can challenge any intereſt in. There were Candleſticks, Baſons, Tongs, Snuffers, and there were Pins and Aſhes, about the Tabernacle; an aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted perſon is not a pin, not a duſt of the Tabernacle, he cannot write himſelf by the title of one Cinder of the Sanctuary; not the leaſt ſcruple of the Church of Chriſt militant, he is not the duſt of the ballance of the Sanctuary; and yet 'tis ſtrange to conſider the ſpirit of ſtrangers, they think they are wronged, when they are denied the

Aliaens are alienated from the name of God, and from the <hi>life of God,</hi> that's one expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the life which the Apoſtle uſeth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Having their underſtandings darkened, being alienated from the life of God, becauſe of the blindneſſe of their hearts.</hi> Alienation ſpeaks God gone, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting externals, but the weight of the expreſſion lies in this, God gone from the ſoul, the heart without the <hi>life of God,</hi> through darkneſſe. The <hi>life of God,</hi> is heart-panting to follow Chriſt: Life makes pulſation: <hi>Did you ſee my Beloved? Which way is he gone, that I may go after him?</hi> Blind hearts beat out themſelves after other things, no pulſation of ſpirit after Chriſt, this ſpeaks the ſoul dead, alienated from the <hi>life of God</hi> through darkneſſe. As mens principles are, ſo they ſtirre to or from God, after, or away from Chriſt, ſtrangers to God, their principles are ſtrange; divinity is no rule, reaſon is no rule. <hi>That we may be delivered from unreaſonable and wicked men.</hi> That's wickedneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which deſtroyes divinity and reaſon, and yet 'tis ſpoken of aliens, whoſe luſt is their law, their belly their god; not one luſt, but many luſts: they ſerve <hi>divers luſts.</hi> 'Tis a ſtrange life that ſtrangers to God lead, they obey that which God and nature for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids, they ſerve luſts againſt religion and reaſon. Reaſon is low divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, teaching things neceſſary and comly to the body; it runs forth into many principles, and makes conſcience to keep them, till tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation be ſtrong, and then an alien becomes unreaſonable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, a brute beaſt. <hi>Every man is brutiſh, by his knowledge, the founder is confounded by his graven Image,</hi> Jerem. 51.17. Paſtors brutiſh, people brutiſh; temptations came, and inſtructed perſons waved all, divinity, reaſon, and moved as nonſenſically as wilde brutes; and this is the <hi>Proprium</hi> of an alienated ſtate in ſtrength, one at an utter diſtance from the <hi>life of God.</hi> Even amongſt them that are far off from God, ſome are neerer then others. <hi>Thou art not far from the Kingdome of God,</hi> and yet ſo far, that Chriſt had no kingdome in the man, not ſimple ſubjection to his will, which is

that alienation from the <hi>life of God,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Finally, Alienation ſpeakes a condition without hope. At that time you were ſtrangers from the Covenant of promiſe, <hi>having no hope.</hi> Divine priviledge is graduall, every ſtep to Heaven, a heaven: a ſtranger to God cannot <hi>de jure,</hi> ſet hiS foot upon one round of <hi>Jacobs</hi> ladder, he cannot without preſumption, promiſe himſelfe any good, and yet nothing more common with perſons unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Chriſt, then to hope for good when bad is upon them. I hope all will be better one day: but when will that day be? They doe not this upon warrantable grounds; for alienation is a condition without hope; a man in this ſtate may fancy what he will, and ſet his ſoule at a greater diſtance from mercie then 'tis, but he can warrantably expect no felicitie for time to come, what ever his preſent miſery be. Miſery I know is graduall, ſome are nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer hell upon earth then others, yet the moſt is juſt, it merits no pitie, neither can the largeſt head alive, argue any pitie from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie, but from the qualitie of the partie in it; if he be a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to God, 'twill be ſtranger with him, yet then 'tis, and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now nor then, muſt he or may he hope, to have things better, whilſt he abides naught, an alien from God. The qualitie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is all; perſons neere God, let diſtreſſe be what it will, and ſeeme to ſet them never ſo far from God, yet they may and ſhould hope: perſons farre from God, muſt let his favour lie at the ſame diſtance from them, which they let himſelfe; God will have none meddle with his favours in the leaſt kind, which let alone himſelfe, not ſo much as fancy them as theirs, or that ever they ſhall be theirs; if any thing riſes in their ſoule this way, God blaſts it. <hi>The hope of Aliens periſheth,</hi> they have no hope of good; if they create any, God blaſts it; 'tis a condition without hope. All runs into this, <hi>Alienation is a condition wholly ſhut out from all divine pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge.</hi>

                  </label> Whoſe condition this is, ſhould be laid to heart ſpeedily: men far off from God, are not far from hell. The farther from God, the leſſe conſidered, that's the plague of this State. Alienation is a graduall thing; ſome God viſits very ſeldome, they live ſo farre from him, ſcarce a lively ſtirring of heart in many weekes, in many moneths together. The ſoule goes one way, and God goes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſtrangers take their leave, ah Lord, who knows when or
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:113418:125"/>
where they will meet! aliens and ſtrangers what is it to you, that God comes ſo little at you? Little or much? Nothing more ſad to a ſenſible ſoule, then the loſſe of divine preſence: God gone, a good heart is broke. Woe is me, now all is gone, now I am undone, and never till now. <hi>Why hideſt thou thy face farre away?</hi> This was the wound that went to the heart, and yet this is nothing, if other things be preſent, to one that is a ſtranger. Wee little lament the departure of ſuch as we know not, wee let ſtrangers come and goe, and take no notice. Sinners, what doe yee injoy of God? much or little? When was he with you? Not a great while. When will he againe? I know not: I doubt whether ever any more. Ah Lord! how didſt thou uſe Chriſt then? didſt thou as the <hi>Gaderens,</hi> thruſt him out of dore?</p>
               <p>Alienation is ſometime eterniz'd, ah tremble at that every heart! dogged uſage of Chriſt, makes this. <hi>See my face no more,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> to <hi>Moſes.</hi> Thou haſt well ſaid, <hi>I will ſee thy face no more,</hi> ſaith <hi>Moſes,</hi> and Chriſt in him. What a ſad parture was here! Such a parture had <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> but they lived not long neither of them after this. Some ſay to the Almightie depart: ah wretches! is not God farre enough from you alreadie? Will you have him quite gone? This is the ſin of this generation: our hearts ſwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt truth, wee bid the Almightie depart. Sinfull <hi>England,</hi> God is gone very farre from thee, doſt thou not feele it? Thou wilt. Wilt thou have God quite gone? Woe unto ſinners, if God judge them in the perverſneſſe of their hearts. If God take a perſon or a Kingdome at their word, he returnes no more till they die, he comes no more but to the funerall. Mercy is everlaſting, ſo is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and it acts ſo upon us, upon deſperate diſcoveries; God doth not alwayes ſtrike. Whom God loves, he loves to the end, and whom he hates, he hates to the end, when all meanes to gaine love, are throwne off. Know the ſtate of your ſoules, perverneſſe in any ſin, ſpeakes your ſoules <hi>farre from Gods law,</hi> Pſal. 119.150. one far from Gods law, is far from God: know the danger of your ſoules, God may be ſo farre gone from you, that he will not returne; <hi>Yee ſhall die in your ſinnes,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, or in this your ſin you ſhall die.</p>
               <p>Perverſe ſinners muſt have their portion, but humble hearts muſt not wrong themſelves. Perſons never ſo far off, that would be
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:113418:125"/>
neere, verily God is very inclinable: conflicts are ſtrong in ſome hearts, ſin now and then is too hard, and then the ſoule concludes that condition is deſperate. God will not take me by the hand, and therefore I fall and fall, and ſhall doe ſo till I fall as low as hell. God hath taken ſomething unkindly, and is gone far away. God hideth his face in wrath ſometimes, and then he and the ſoule ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver meet, till the great day: that's my caſe, methinkes I heare ſome poore ſinner ſay: Conſcience is out with me, that condemnes me; God is quite out with me, he will not looke towards me, but he forbeares condemning, till that day in which he will doe it once for all. This ſoule muſt be told this, The naked acting of ſin, ſpeaks not the condition deſperate, God finally gone, but abiding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſly in it. Secondly, the medium of returning God to man is Chriſt, throw not off Chriſt, becauſe thou think'ſt God hath throwne off thee: The leaſt degree of faith, will turne God about towards a poore ſinner, and all good that hath forſaken him. Wee are <hi>made neere by the bloud of Chriſt (i.)</hi> by believing in it. When mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is thus held out, conflicting ſoules queſtion the latitude of it; Chriſt doth make many afar off neere, but he will not doe this for me; ſuch muſt read the latitude of the promiſe, none are excluded. <hi>I create peace to them that are neere, and to them that are farre off:</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons diſcourage not Chriſts undertaking, let them be who they will: the worke diſcourages not Chriſts undertaking, though the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in the world; though it be as the creating of another world, to bring God and the ſoule together, yet Chriſt undertakes it for them that groane after it. I create the fruit of the lips, peace to them that are far off. Sin wounds, and then Satan makes it mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, this muſt be looked to: 'tis the worke of Chriſt to ſeeke out poore ſoules, which are ſtray'd away from God, and to carry them home to him in his arme.</p>
               <p>We that enjoy the preſence of God, ſhould joy and bleſſe him, ſo I conclude this point. Alienation is a ſad condition, it hints lively what the contrary is, to wit, a fruition of all priviledge, a ſoule in the boſome of God, one <hi>ever with the Lord,</hi> which is Heaven. <hi>In thy preſence is the fulneſſe of joy:</hi> 'tis ſo here, God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in an Ordinance, God preſent in a Saint, God preſent in a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and there is fulneſſe of joy to the ſoul, what ever be to the body. Much company ſpoiles ſome, ſo doth much ſolitude others:
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:113418:126"/>
a man is too much alone, when without God. Society is never too few, nor too many, when God is one: Delight, not too little, nor too much, when God is preſent. If I had never ſo many enemies, I would care but for the company of one to encounter them. 'Tis enemies we fear now, it ſhould not be. Fear not, <hi>I am with thee:</hi> So 'twas ſpoken to <hi>Gideon, The Lord is with thee.</hi> God takes it for granted, that he hath ſpoken enough to ſetle any heart againſt any feare, when he hath ſaid, we ſhall have his preſence, Read <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 64.1, 2. <hi>O that thou wouldeſt rend the heavens, that thou wouldeſt come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy preſence, as when the melting fire burneth; The fire cauſeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adverſaries, that the nations may tremble at thy preſence:</hi> Let's priſe much that condition which cannot be undone; having Chriſt with us, we have him whoſe preſence can make mountains melt, turn any thing to nothing that nihilates our felicity.</p>

               <p>SUch a tree, ſuch fruit; what a ſad ſtate alienation from God is, appears by the effects, which are here to the life expreſſed; it makes a man all over naught; inſide, outſide, heart, hand; it caſts all into a reſolute poſture of defiance againſt God. <hi>Enemies in your mind by wicked works;</hi> or, <hi>enemies with your mind, in wicked works;</hi> not nillingly, but willingly wicked; not ſo in affection on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but in action; not in one action only, but in many <hi>actions; enemies in their mind, in wicked [works].</hi>

               <p>The words of God are of weight, every one hath much in it, 'twill appear ſo, being diſtinctly conſidered, which hath been, and ſhall be, our method and manner of following of him who is ſo far above us, and will not let one tittle of his will fall to the ground. Alienation is here anatomiſed, we muſt reade lectures diſtinctly, upon diſtinct parts. <hi>They are enemies,</hi> &amp;c.

upon this alſo: They are thus not only in affection, but in action, in their <hi>works.</hi> We muſt conſider this too, and by that time you will ſee much of a bad condition, and it may be, ſomething of your own. The Land is overrun with enemies againſt Chriſt, therefore it bleeds and dies; 'twill be very ſeaſonable therefore, to lay open to you, what an enemy to Chriſt is, which is our firſt work here in the Text, to follow the words as they lie. <hi>And ye which were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alienated, enemies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Sin was Gods firſt enemy; a ſteady purſuit of this, renders men and Angels the next. The worſt man alive as a creature, ſimply as a creature, is not accounted Gods enemy, but as theſe noble creatures above all others, proſtituted themſelves to ſomething beſides Gods will. God had no enemies till ſin came into the world; as long as all obeyed Gods will, there was love and friendſhip all the world over. Sin hath a legall and a Goſpel conſideration: conſidered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former, the leaſt tranſgreſſion of rule, the eating of any fruit forbidden, enough to render man an enemy, and to be purſued ſo with all the plagues written in Gods Book. Sin hath a Goſpel conſideration, and ſo the naked acting of ſin, doth not preſently denote an enemy, but the going on in it, as a conſtant intended and approved courſe. <hi>God ſhall ſmite the head of his enemies, and the hairy ſcalp of ſuch as go on ſtill in their treſpaſſes,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt.</hi> Sin is an unwearied courſe to ſome, what ever rubs they meet with from the hand of God, by blows or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, yet they ſtep over them all, and go on ſtill: That's an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the ſpirit of an enemy is in him. Enemies fear no colours, blows, blood, death, will not divert their deſign againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The expreſſion in the originall, ſpeaks not only reſolution, but delight in ſin, and there are not two fuller properties more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly to expreſſe an enemy <hi>ambulandis dilictis, ſuch as walk in ſins:</hi> a mans walk is his pleaſure, 'tis made and contrived of purpoſe with much art, to ſuit fancy, and to give a complacency. As the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, ſo the inward man has his walks, ſomething that with much induſtry he makes &amp; ſhapes, to ſuit and delight it ſelf, and this is preferr'd before all other wayes; now if this be any thing diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Gods will, this ſpeaks the man an enemy.</p>
               <p>Some words of Chriſt ſet out an enemy more generally, others more particularly; I ſhall touch both: Chriſt is ſet as King over
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:113418:127"/>
the ſons of men, his Lawes are written and divulged, and ſuch as obey him not according to theſe, he calls his enemies: <hi>Bring thoſe mine enemies, which would not that I ſhould raign over them,</hi> (i.) ſuch as will not obey my will. Some diſobey one part of Gods will, and ſome another. Chriſt hath many ſorts of enemies, but all ſo called from one ground, to wit, diſobeying of his Lawes. The Lawes of Chriſt are ſaid to be diſobeyed, when careleſly neglected, ignorant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed, or maliciouſly rejected. Truth is truth with ſome men, and that's all, as one would ſay; it bears little or no price in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how plain and convincing ſoever to judgement; they ſee, and do not ſee <hi>(i.)</hi> ſee, and do not regard. <hi>O that thou hadſt known in this thy day,</hi> &amp;c. Did not <hi>Iſrael</hi> know the will of God? yes, there was light, but no love to it, which was as no light in the account of Chriſt, and this went to his heart. Such as ſtab Chriſt to the heart, are ſurely his enemies. 'Tis as if Chriſt had ſaid, O that thou hadſt regarded! and ſo it notes an ignorance of opportunity, a defect in affection, and not ſimply an ignorance of the thing it ſelf. Love naught, and the heart is ſo too; hatred in the ſeeds of it, lie in ſuch a ſoul which will ſpring up with a little more rain. A man naught at heart, is Gods enemy. Neutrality hath the ſeeds of enmity; there is the buddings of hatred where love is but cold to Chriſt. Men that love not, hate truth: <hi>They that are not with me, are againſt me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; and all that are againſt Chriſt, though never ſo gently, neutrally, and indifferently, yet are his enemies. <hi>Judas</hi> was an enemy when no hearty lover, as well as when an actuall betrayer of Chriſt. Enmity is ſown deep, it lies long under ground, and puts up with a very little blade at firſt, no body takes it for ſuch a deadly weed as 'tis, it may be not the party in whoſe heart it lies; but the Lord of the vineyard, who knowes all grain in its firſt bud, calls men and things as they are; this is a Serpent by kinde, though it do not ſting yet, he will do. Falſe love is true hatred; Cinders will burn out anon, when blown.</p>
               <p>Chriſt is diſobeyed, when ſtubbornly oppoſed: Some are figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters againſt God, and will be ſo, theſe are deadly enemies. <hi>Deliver me from my deadly enemies,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 17.9. There is fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt God within, and fighting againſt God without; ſtrong art and induſtry to kill conſcience, in a mans ſelf and others; this is a bloody enemy. Chriſt knocks at moſt mens doors, though he
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:113418:127"/>
can have entrance into few. Not a ſoul where the Goſpel comes, but he ſtrives and wreſtles with it, to gain it to God: pravity cannot bear theſe conflicts, ſomething is taken to deſtroy concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, vineger is uſed to prevent vomiting, to ſtay and ſtill the wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtomack, that it may hold what it hath; acts of violence ruſhed upon, to darken that light that troubles, and any <hi>medium</hi> good, that may but ſtupifie that faculty that ſtings; when the ſoul chooſeth his own way, this is called reſiſting the <hi>Holy Ghoſt;</hi> this is a fight under deck, a murthering Chriſt in the cradle, theſe are Chriſts bloody enemies. Chriſt layes the axe to the root of ſome ſinners, and ſome ſinners lay the axe to the root of Chriſt; as ſoon as ever any word of Chriſt begins to take hold of the heart, as ſoon as ever Chriſt begins to ſtir in the conſcience, or affection, (as if the ſoule were on fire on hell) all means are uſed to quench the Spirit, hell is ſent for to keep out heaven, many bad ſpirits to keep out one good; there are ſad iſſues of this: men kill themſelves ſometimes, rather then Chriſt ſhould live in them.</p>
               <p>Oppoſition hath rejection folded up in it, this is diſtinguiſhed from that, as it carries deſpight againſt the ſpirit of grace, &amp; makes the hand bloudy, if need be, as well as the heart and tongue, with the bloud of Gods deareſt ones, theſe are <hi>Eſaus,</hi> red all over. <hi>And the firſt came out red all over, like an hairy garment, and I called his name Eſau,</hi> Gen. 25.25.

                  </label> What is your ſtate? This is my errand from this point to you; Are you enemies, or friends to God? Amongſt Chriſtians this may ſeeme a ſtrange queſtion, yet needfull: all are not <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who are of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Chriſt hath enemies in his own houſe, would we knew them; would they knew themſelves. 'Tis a time of much oppoſition, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty againſt party, this ſide againſt that; if wee ſhould all be found oppoſite to Chriſt, we are undone. Heate tranſports, ſo doth ſelf-ends; ſuch perſons doe they know not what, and are they know not what themſelves; one while this, and another while that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in nothing, but enemies to Chriſt, being ſecretly ſway'd, by blind and baſe principles. Say we not well, that thou art ſo and ſo, and haſt a Devill. Hypocriſie knowes every one but her ſelf, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, knowes another to be a Devill, an arch enemy to Chriſt, but knowes not her ſelfe to be ſo. To miſtake others, proves ſometimes
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:113418:128"/>
afflicting; but to miſtake our ſelves is damning; O how ſhould we beg to be delivered from this. In a trying time, wherein many prove rotten, let us doe as Chriſts diſciples, lay our hand upon our own heart, <hi>is it I?</hi> Tell me, O Chriſt, is it I that am an enemy to thee? A man that looks into his heart, and then looks up to God, he will know much. He that tasketh himſelfe but to know one, will certainly finde him out; but he that tasketh himſelfe to know many, and to call them by their names, as hypocrites, or the like, will certainly miſtake them, or himſelfe, or both. Truth and the heart compar'd, ſpeake out one another. Chriſt puts us all upon an exact way to know the thing in queſtion: <hi>Yee are my friends, if yee doe whatſoever I command.</hi> A friend loves not onely in word, but in deed; what you are in action for Chriſt, ſpeakes out what you are in denomination, whether friends or enemies. <hi>Yee are my friends if yee doe, &amp;c.</hi> Good talke is cheape, hath a great many friends, if this were it. But what doe yee doe for Chriſt? Action alſo muſt have its latitude, or els doing is nothing neither. The will of Chriſt runs forth into many precepts, that's obedience which excepts againſt none. Then are yee my friends, if yee <hi>doe whatſoever I command you.</hi> Truth is Homogeniall, one precept ſweet, and all precepts are ſo, when the heart is right: the heart is naught, the man an enemy to Chriſt, that is partiall in his Law. Yet this is the plague of moſt mens hearts: Surely Chriſt hath more enemies a great many then we are aware of. We are for dividing the living childe, therefore are diviſions and rumors amongſt us; it ſpeakes ſtony hearts unnaturallneſſe to Chriſt, he anſwerably handles us; the truths we ſcorne, are the ſwords which kill us as Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as a generation of hypocrites.</p>
               <p>Integrity hath a double univerſalitie in it; all Gods precepts are obeyed, alwayes: a friend loves at all times; it doth not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Chriſt, to day, nor to morrow, nor never will; his bowels will not beare it: all truth is of everlaſting ſweetneſſe, in a ſound ſoule. Chriſt is the bright morning Star: a Star holds its glory, 'tis al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes admirable, a man admires it to day, and admires to morrow, and ſo as long as he liveth; So is Chriſt, in the eye of him, which indeed ſeeth him. The Land in which wee live is ſtony ground; Love withers, it doth ſo very frequently; men that were friends fall off, and become enemies: Apoſtate are the worſt enemies Chriſt
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:113418:128"/>
hath, yet how many doth this time make! The Land is full of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates, therefore it groanes; God is avenging himſelfe upon theſe enemies firſt, fire goeth before him, and burnes up theſe enemies <hi>round about,</hi> Pſal. 97.3. The moſt notorious are made examplary amongſt us; 'tis ſo in the proceedings of God. All the adverſaries of the Lord ſhould tremble, when ſome are executed, and learne inſtruction by his judgements: that wrath is kindled which will burne you all; ſuch of you as are not burnt here, will be burnt in hell. Wrath is a flame that never goes out; it runs all along upon the earth, as 'tis ſaid of the fire which burnt every greene thing in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> time; ſo this burnes every flouriſhing wicked perſon, firſt or laſt, here or hereafter.</p>
               <p>Adverſaries of the Lord, ceaſe your courſe: could one ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the abilitie which Chriſt hath, to right himſelfe upon his enemies, yet 'tis pitie he ſhould have any enemies he is ſo good: he keeps up the earth you goe upon, the heavens you breath in, they would come together elſe, and cruſh you in the midſt; Heaven and earth are full of Gods goodneſſe, though you be bad: you live in the fruition of theſe, and thouſands more as bad as you, and yet he doth not grudge your enjoyment: Chriſt beds you, and boards you; where ever you make a meale, you ſit at his Table, and live upon his expence every day: he gives you your daily bread, all comes out of his Treaſure, who ever be the purſe-bearer, and he payes the Reckoning, who ever carries it to the hoaſt. And now will you, nay, can you be enemies to ſuch a friend, and cut his throat like <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> at his own Table? Chriſt is the ſpirit of your bloud, the red bloud of your cheeks, the white ſinewes of your joynts, the marrow of your bones, the breath of your noſtrills, and can you be enemies to ſuch a friend? Chriſt numbers your haires, writes downe your members, preſſes all the creatures in the world, to ſerve and defend you, and will ye not love him? Can you be enemies to him, or any of his? Chriſt is naturally good, and he is morally good; he is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, long-ſuffering, abundant in this goodneſſe. You have been tranſgreſſors from the wombe, from the Cradle you have fought againſt Chriſt, making your members your weapons, &amp; you would have killed him long ago if you could, &amp; yet he hath not killed you. You have multiplied your tranſgreſſions, ſo that you have made the heavens weepe now for many dayes together; and the earth to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:113418:129"/>
bleed now for many moneths together, you have preſſed the Lord, and all the Creation with your ſins, and yet you are at eaſe, though all theſe be in paine. You have been prodigalls, following exceſſe of riot, chambering, and wantonneſſe, and yet Juſtice hath not eate the noſe off your faces, the fleſh off your bones, nor rotted you limbe by limbe alive, to defraud the grave of her due; and yet can you be enemies to this God? Finally, Chriſt is not onely naturally good, and morally good, but divinely good, he is not onely patient, but mercifull, not onely ſlow to wrath, but ready to forgive; though you have been bloudy enemies, yet he is ready to cleanſe your ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let ſinnes; during all the times you have continued enemies, plotted againſt him, he hath not plotted againſt, but for you. When wee were enemies, God gave his Son. Let my Son goe out of my boſome, ſaith the Father, and let him goe to a wretched world, amongſt millions of enemies, and let him preach to them, pray for them, bleed over them, die for them, that they may not die. Can you now doe any other, but love this God, and love this Chriſt? I can ſay no more, would I could weep out the reſt, for all the enemies of the Lord, which theſe words will not work upon.</p>

The ſoule is a Crabſtock, fit to graffe any forbidden fruit upon, it will naturally give out all its ſap. The advantage of property is all, to make ſuch a life, and in ſuch abundance. The ſoule is, I cannot ſay bleſſed, but curſed, to fruitfulneſſe in evill, as the ground is to Bryars and Thornes: the minde is dunged ground by divine wrath, for every root of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; in it are paſſions to keepe ſin warme, faculties to make legs, armes, eyes, any member for it, to work, provide, and defend it ſelfe, as can be imagined ſufficient for any thing to ſubſiſt withall.

The <hi>Philiſtians</hi> ſtrucke at that in <hi>Sompſon,</hi> by which they might be ſure to rule him, and lead him whither they liſted, though a ſtrong man; they put out his eyes.

Within; he puffs up the minde firſt, and then blowes up all: Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puft up with their fleſhly minde; Satan makes the ſpirit fleſhly firſt, and then makes all fleſhly. If the eye be dark, if the heart be carnnall, all is ſo.

'Tis the greateſt bleſſing in the world, to get Sin and Satan throughly out of the minde. I am affraid, that few of you conſider your own danger, there is malignity in you, you have taken poyſon down in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> hath the ſecond given you any vomit, and made you throw it up? Phyſicians purge your bodies; Doth Chriſt purge your mindes, and your conſciences from defilement? Within lies defilement, which if not purged out, will ſpoile us for ever. <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard was gotten into <hi>Ahabs</hi> minde, 'twas neerer to him internally, then externally; though in the latter ſenſe it lay very neer, and it proved mortall to him; he ſickn'd upon it, and died for ever.</p>

it muſt have, or it dies; this is minding ſin, or ſin gotten into the minde, which was the caſe of <hi>Ahab,</hi> before mentioned. Sin gotten into the minde, nothing can beat it out. 'Tis ſad to conſider how ſome men ſleep, how ſome men talk, and walk in their ſleep, yea, how they talk and walk when they are awake, juſt as if they were aſleep, eſpecially, if one be talking to them of heavenly things. 'Tis dolefull to conſider, how ſome ſit here for an hour; thoughts quite gone, to this thing, and to that. Ah wretches! vanity is got into your minds, it holds its ſeat there, the plague of it is this; God cannot enter, the ſoul will be vexed to death, 'twill become a ſot, or a Bedlam.</p>

Action is laſting that comes from the minde, the minde is an untired power that way it takes; <hi>only evill, and that continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5. Such another power is Satan; Satan roars like a Lion, one would think, it ſhould tear his throat, ſuch violent action, one would think, ſhould make him breaſt, and lung-ſoare, and tire him out; yet it doth not, he goes about gaping and roaring, day and night, and never gives off; he is cordiall in what he doth, he mindes evill, and this is the ground why he is untired. The minde is an untired power, that way it takes in all creatures; the ſpirit evill, and it is ſo only and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. What the heart is taken up with, 'tis very intenſe at it; ſo that one may in a manner ſay, that its only about ſuch a thing, and then it holds its vigor; thus is the ſoul towards one ſin or other, whileſt corruption keeps it's ſeat in the mind. There is a buſie im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall ſubſtance in the midſt of you, 'twere well, if you did know about what. <hi>Some minde earthly things,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> (i.) upon the matter only, and continually; this man is carnally minded, and it will be his death, if God be not gracious to him. If ſin hold its ſeat in the minde againſt all means, there is no way but one with the man, if ſin die not in the ſoul, the ſoul dies in it; <hi>Ye ſhall die in your ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis the greateſt bleſſing in the world to get ſin throughly out of the mind, not only by way of negation, but by way of actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fruition, not privatively only, but poſitively too.

God, and the glory of another world. Sin throughly out of the mind, and all tears are wiped from the eyes already. What makes mourning and ſadneſſe amongſt Saints here, but that ſin keeps ſtill in their minds, the evill working of their mindes? The minde pure, and conſcience is quiet, peace is ſetled; nothing can burthen when the minde is free. Sin throughly out of the minde, and it becomes preſently the Preſence-chamber of the great King; in no creature is Chriſt ſo preſent, as in a pure minde, the full explanation of this is above us.</p>

'Twere well if a ſinners ſentence of himſelf would ſtand, when Chriſt comes to ſentence all things over again: 'Tis ſad, when a mans ſervant ſhall lie out night after night, and told of it, and yet continue it, and ſtand in it, that all was againſt his will; ſo doth your ſouls lie out of Chriſts boſome day after day, and night after night, and you have been told of it, and whipt for it, and yet ſo you have continued, and is all againſt your will? If will be ſo innocent, why are you ſo unmoved in evill? Full of action, and yet without any paſſion; you can do any thing to accompliſh carnall ends, and lay nothing to heart to break your ſleep a wink. With a light companion, and a pipe of Tobacco, you can whiffe away any thing that gathers about your heart, and yet none muſt believe that you are not hearty in your way. Art will put off bad wares, but 'twill not a bad heart: Let's hear no more pleading for ſelf, there needs no other demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a willing tranſgreſſor. Own your condition, and what is due to it: You are enemies with your mindes againſt God, and ſo he will be againſt you; you ſhall be puniſhed with plague after plague, and God will never repent. You ſin, and ſin, and never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſo will God judge you: When God lays any ſad thing upon his people, he doth not <hi>afflict willingly;</hi> his people do not ſin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, they repent; in like proportion doth God carry himſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them.

               <p>Remedy muſt be ſpeedy; two enemies that ſet to it with their minde, will diſpatch one another quickly, if they be not parted. Wilfull ſinners, you cannot ſtrike ſo deſperately againſt God, as he doth againſt you; every blow is upon your heart, he is turning that into a ſtone, which work done, you will ſink preſently, like

Doth a ſtone uſe any ſtruggling to keep up, when 'tis falling downe? Wilfull ſinners, this is your judgement written in your foreheads, you will goe laughing, like Bedlams, to everlaſting chaines: you will have no booke, nor aske for none. Will as it runs its courſe, ſwels bigger and bigger, and it ſwels ſo big at laſt, that it will breake eternally, rather then ſtoop to God or man.

Every diſh would not downe with the Patriarch: ſo every diſh is not ſavoury meate to God, he muſt have veniſon, how hard ſoever we hunt for it. What action is unfavoury, is wicked. Perſons want ſalt ſometimes. <hi>If that have loſt its ſavour, caſt it to the dunghill,</hi> this is ſpoken of perſons: ſo actions want ſalt ſometimes. If actions have loſt their ſavour, caſt them to the dunghill, ſaith the Lord, as abominable things. Weakneſſe or wantonneſſe of palate is not with God, but perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of will: What he commands for offering, is our obedience to bring; to bring leſſe is wicked, to bring more is wicked; to adde or detract is wicked action, according to the matter; To have Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> when that at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was enough, to ſet up poſts, to helpe beare up Gods poſt, and make his houſe of more roomes, and more rafters then he has made it, is wicked action.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Action may be called wicked, from the forme of it; 'tis not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that there be good metall, but there muſt be a good mould,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:113418:133"/>
to make a good bell. Chriſtian action is a piece full of art, it muſt be ſo caſt, as to carry the image and face of Chriſt in it, or elſe 'tis wicked. God lookes for his image in our perſons, and in our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or elſe he diſclaimes both as wicked. There is the matter of dutie, and the circumſtance, and both under expreſſe command. You ſhall doe this, and you ſhall doe it thus: pray and pray <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently;</hi> give and give <hi>liberally;</hi> rule and rule <hi>diligently;</hi> in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of theſe circumſtances, conſiſts the formalitie of action, in theſe ſmall lines lies the feature of Chriſt, the forme of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; hit theſe and you hit the white: theſe obſerved, and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian brings forth a childe like God, ſuch a one as will own God, and God it any where. Hypocriſie draws out her ſelfe, not Chriſt in action, when matter is allowed of, but manner of divine action muſt depend upon the humour of the man. A humerous Chriſtian allowes ſuch and ſuch diſhes at Wiſdomes table, but he will ſower or ſweeten them himſelfe, and eate what he will, and when he will; a line of his own will muſt be read and obſerved in every buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or elſe he is no body: this is wicked action. Life is the ſum of action, this muſt be hid quite in the life of Chriſt, or elſe the life is wicked. <hi>[Not I] but Chriſt lives in me.</hi> If I act ſo that any thing of ſelfe lives in the action <hi>(i)</hi> that a mans own will orders the will of God in any thing, though but in the leaſt circumſtance, 'tis wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked action: Formalitie in action, ſpeakes the exactneſſe of it to rule.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Finally, Action is called wicked from the end of it: the glory of Chriſt is the end of action, what miſſeth this ſcope is wicked. You may extract oyle from any thing, but what gives it naturally is called an Olive tree. You may force ſpeech upon a bird, but what intends ſuch an act, that creature which intends a word, and purpoſeth ſuch a ſignification to others, is a man. So ſupreame power can force any creature in the world, to doe ſuch and ſuch ſervice to him, but that which doth propoſe and intend ſuch ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Lord God, and to and for his glory onely, that is called Chriſtian action. Some run as a byaſſed bowle, with an acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall inclination to good: put ſome ponderous thing into one ſide of a bowle, as Lead, or the like, and 'twill incline it in running, to the right hand or to the left, but it hath this inclination meerly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentall; take out the weight in the ſide, 'twill not doe ſo, but run
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:113418:134"/>
round as it is: ſo put ſilver enough in the pockets of ſome perſons, fill the hole in the ſide of the bowle, and the man will worke hard and run which way you will have him; this man ſeekes not you but yours, not the glory of Chriſt, but his belly; he aimes at him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, therefore ſhoots naught, 'tis wicked action. Intention in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is with more or leſſe ſtrength; where 'tis with much ſtrength, what is aimed at, though it be never ſo wicked, is made compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiall to the ſoule, which makes wicked action notoriouſly wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Scope is univerſally naught, where hypocriſie is thick and deep. <hi>They doe all things to be ſeene of men,</hi> this is action abominably wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Aime is the firſt thing ſtirring, though the laſt thing accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. Action is at the very root rotten and wicked, when inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is awry, therefore is this action called wicked with emphaſis, violation of Gods will, and loving of it. <hi>The Lord loveth the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but the wicked and him that loveth violence, his ſoule he hateth, Pſal.</hi> 11.5.

                  </label> Motion is a tickle thing, your life is rapt up in it. You ſhould not worke at randome; with your owne hands you my cut your throats; by your works you ſhall be judged or juſtified; if they be judged wicked, ſo ſhall you, and be made to eate the fruit of your wayes for ever. Man is a rude creature; 'tis too ſtrict to worke by rule, any thing done is enough. Yea 'tis enough, well enough, to be called wicked enough, to judge you. Careleſneſſe is a graduall thing, man begins to be remiſſe a little about his worke, and then a little more, at laſt by divine judgement upon the ſoule, the man throwes off all care and conſcience, how he doth his dutie to God or man. <hi>Am I my brothers keeper?</hi> This ſpake he who a little before ſaid as much in action to God himſelf, by a carnall offering to him. Conſider ſeriouſly at what pitch and poſture of remiſneſſe in divine action you are, if you doe ill tremblingly, ſtop there, acknowledge that power within, that jogges you to look better to your way: if the feare of God be quite gone, that you doe wickedly freely, merrily, thinke of that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that <hi>God will bring every worke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to judgement.</hi> Wicked workes have a double judgement, a judgement
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:113418:134"/>
here and hereafter. All motion to well being is ſucceſleſſe, much got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten comes to nothing, becauſe heaped together by wicked workes; Name withers, ſtate, yea, ſtrength withers; judged without, and judged within; Conſcience lights a fire with ſome wicked worke or other, and no worke ſo good can be wrought as to quench it. <hi>They ſhall feele a paine in their bellies,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>Job</hi> 20.20. What you worke outward, God makes to worke inward in the guts, to torture there, and make roaring. You that make nothing to ſpeake wickedly, and doe wickedly, God makes as light to doe juſtly. You are undone ſinners, if God ingrave but one wicked worke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your conſcience, this will ever be before you, and then a devill will ever be behind you, and between theſe two you will erect a gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, and hang your ſelves, if the Lord be not gracious, and what a fatall wicked worke will this be!</p>
               <p>Some heare ſuch things as theſe, and then goe merrily to mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their workes in all poſt haſte, and never thinke of their hearts nor Chriſt. The hand goes after the heart: doe yee look without? look within too, if ever you meane to mend things. <hi>In ſin was I borne,</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> when he looked upon that bloudy wickedneſſe againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> Alas for me! I brought a wicked ſoule with me into the world, this hath brought forth this horrid and bloudy act into the world. My miſery lies deeper then every one is aware. I ſhall ſhed bloud againe and againe, I ſhall make <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riahs</hi> bloud touch the bloud of many other men, if the Lord be not mercifull to my wicked ſoule. Doth thy hand worke naught? uſe it to ſmite thine heart, that's the firſt ſtep to get it to move well. O if Chriſt were in my heart, I ſhould worke admirable well. I can doe all things through Chriſt, yea and I can doe all well. There needs many things in the ſoule, to make action holy: exact knowledge, exact faith, &amp;c. and Chriſt is all theſe. In the darke men worke naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily: a blind ſoule cannot act well. Action muſt be ſquared by truth, but ignorant perſons know not the rule. Chriſt is light, he is ſo in the darkeſt ſoule; as a pearle he ſparkles and gliſters in a dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, in what ever breaſt, in what ever darke cell you put him. Scales fell from <hi>Pauls</hi> eyes, but 'twas Chriſt in him that did it, and he knew Chriſt preſently, and to doing good workes he would goe preſently. <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to doe?</hi> He underſtood much in a little while, his Maſter, his ſervice, and wanted nothing but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:113418:135"/>
miſſion, as before he had diabolicall. <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> A man is made very knowing with one Tutor.</p>
               <p>Affection tends to make good action; <hi>If I do this, and that, and have not love.</hi> Love alone doth not well; <hi>If the blinde lead the blind,</hi> &amp;c. Here is a great deal of love, but both fall into the ditch, and drown both it and themſelves. Light and love toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do well; Chriſt is both, he is a light of life in the ſoul where he is. Coldneſſe is the property of a ſtone, there is no ſoul in this body, a ſtone ſtirs not, unleſſe it be downward. Folly talks to the grief of the wiſe; I do not love ſudden pangs: ſome will do great matters preſently, and what noble works they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, when in the company of ſome, a little warmer then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and no ſooner theſe more lively ſpirits departed from them, but they return to their proper temper, as cold as ſtones, and doing nothing but deſcending downward to their place; theſe mens ears were warmed, and not their hearts. The heart fired with love to Chriſt, 'twill give name, ſtate, every drop of blood to Chriſt, and theſe are noble works indeed. Noble actions are of ſeverall ſorts, that's the nobleſt that offers up all to Chriſt, that forſakes all to follow him, father, mother, husband, wife, ſelf; love doth this, ſhe offers nothing but whole burnt-offerings, holocauſts.</p>
               <p>Finally, faith alſo bears its proper part, to make a good work. 'Tis the higheſt art in the world to do a good work; a man muſt pray with the mouth of Chriſt, and then 'tis a good prayer; a man muſt give with the hand of Chriſt, and then 'tis good almes: a man muſt do all that Chriſt ſayes, but then muſt lean only upon what Chriſt is, to make a good action. A man muſt do all, and then undo all, to make it throughly good, <hi>(i.)</hi> deny all, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all my actions nothing, my ſelf nothing, and make Chriſt as fully and purely all to reſt on, as if I had never ſo much as thought one good thought, in all my life. A man not himſelf, is but a bad Artificer, but a Chriſtian, when not himſelf, <hi>(i.)</hi> when out of himſelf, is a brave Artiſt; then a Chriſtian works bravely, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, heavenly indeed, when quite off himſelf, and wholly in the boſome and armes of Chriſt, in all he doth. There go many things to make up this or that ſecular thing good, but one to make a Divine good, to wit Chriſt; there is none good but one, and there is none that properly does good but one, to wit, Chriſt.
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:113418:135"/>
There is as few good Artiſts for the practick part of Chriſtianity, as of any calling; many actions go through our hands only and never through the hands of Chriſt, and theſe are all loſt as wicked works. All that goes out of our hands, muſt be put by faith into the hands of Chriſt, then 'tis maturated, and ſhall meet us as ſo many royall Diadems, to adorn us for ever.</p>
               <p>You ſee now the way to work well, thus work, and your work will be work and wages; 'Tis a very ſweet life, to do all in Chriſt. Things are very lively and contentfull in their own element: Set a Lark to flie in the open aire, 'tis his element, 'tis his heaven, he will flie upward, upward, which is very hard work, and yet he will do this, and ſing too. The breaſt of Chriſt is the proper element of a Chriſtian, and when here, a man works nimbly, he works and ſings too, goes upward towards that place above, which is very hard work, and yet ſings as he goes, becauſe he has ſuch ſilver wings from Chriſt. <hi>If ye abide in me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ye will do bravely, you will bring forth good works,</hi> as a Garden, as a Vine doth fruits, <hi>ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</hi> Let's work as Chriſt did, and we ſhall finde our work as he did; 'twas meat and drink to him to do his Fathers will; his works were all works <hi>wrought in God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. Let a Chriſtian ſet himſelf in Chriſt, when he goes about any action, and he ſhall finde his work will be very ſweet, work and wages, <hi>his meat and drink.</hi> No motion ſo free and delightfull as Chriſtian moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; where 'tis purely Chriſtian. We ſet upon work out of Chriſt, and then the Chariot wheels move heavily, and we look ſadly, and are tired preſently, Chriſts ſayings are ſo hard to be done; by this a ſtumbling block is caſt before men of the world, the works and wayes of God evill ſpoken of. To work divine works, is the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt, the ſweeteſt life in the world, if a man take the advantage of his work, that is, Chriſt with him in every thing; a Chriſtian and Chriſt will do any thing with eaſe, remove mountains, ſins, harder to be removed then mountains, and ſtand and ſmile to behold the <hi>plagues of death: O death, I will be thy plagues;</hi> to be the plagues of the king of plagues, is brave action indeed. A man might ſpeak more conſolatory from this point. Every workman in Chriſts Vineyard, hath a <hi>peny</hi> here, and Chriſts peny is more then any ones pound, but I cannot ſtand to ſum up this now.</p>

The heavens are generall in their influence, not one graſſe on the ground, but dewed. The Ark had of all ſorts brought into it; from the Eaſt, Weſt, North and South, come and ſit downe in the Kingdome of God: As perſons are in eſtate, ſo they invite, and ſo they feaſt. Chriſt is a great King over all the earth, and ſo he invites over all the earth; he hath one houſe that will hold all, he hath one table that will hold all; yea, he hath one diſh that will ſerve all, and anſwerably he invites, <hi>Ho, every one that thirſts.</hi> If

there be any thing looked at in thoſe which Chriſt invites, 'tis ſomething within, not any thing without. If the man be lame, blinde, halt, if he be bodily ſoare, yet its nothing; if <hi>he would ſit</hi> at Gods table, and if <hi>he would</hi> have crums or flagons, this is all that is looked at.</p>
               <p>God doth univerſally invite, and he doth affectionatly invite,<note place="margin">Affectionatly.</note> which loudly ſpeaks his love free. The world is deaf; 'twould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage any one to make a feaſt for a company of deaf folks, ſtocks and blocks, that one muſt ſtrain ones lungs, to make them heare, and yet it doth not diſcourage God; certainly his love is very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate, God doth lay his mouth to the eare of the deaf, and <hi>cries aloud, [Ho] every one that thirſts. John</hi> was a <hi>crier</hi> in the Wilderneſſe, he did Chriſts work; ſo are we at this day, and the injunction is, <hi>to cry aloud</hi> like a trumpet; ſpirits, lungs, nothing to be ſpared, in expreſſion of Gods affection to mans eternall good. Souls are precious to God, diſtreſſe is laid to heart as 'tis: bowels ſound, lungs ſound, <hi>[Ho] every one,</hi> &amp;c. vocations, interjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſpeaks very affectionate motion towards the diſtreſſed: <hi>Why will you die, O Jeruſalem?</hi> Matters of weight move not us, we make expreſſion from no impreſſion; God ſmites his heart again and again, and then ſpeaks and proffers love. <hi>O Ephraim, what ſhall I do unto thee, O Judah? how ſhall I give thee up?</hi> God calls and knocks, and waites; he calls and beſeeches; calls and weeps: what he utters is from his heart, that it may go to our heart. Things are ſo molded and ſhaped, as to make their own way: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word of God, hath ſo much Majeſty and ſweetneſſe, conviction and conſolation, which plainly ſpeaks him very free, and willing to be reconciled to man. Who puts on ſuch apparell when he wooes a Spouſe, as Chriſt does? Who ſpeaks ſuch effectuall words, or preſents ſuch precious jewels when he wooes, as Chriſt doth?</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I will give you ſomething elſe to demonſtrate this thing to you. God purſues prerogative altogether in his gracious diſpenſations: Grace muſt needs be in all reſpects free, becauſe no obligement is upon God, to give to this, rather then to that. <hi>I will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom I will have mercy.</hi> The counſell of Gods will, is his guide: Mercy goes forth and embraces this or that perſon, and not from any reſpect elſe, but Gods will; he does all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>counſell of his will:</hi> Prerogative carries all with him.
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:113418:137"/>
God is free, and will be free, to give what he will, to whom he will; he hath no reſpect nor obligement upon him, nor will have: <hi>I will have mercy upon whom I will;</hi> men proffer to ſome perſons this or that, to induce them to do this or that for them, and they ſay no; what we do, we will do freely: God is ſuch a noble Spirit. The whole creation is ſpiritually turned into a Chaos, darkneſſe is upon the face of the deep, upon the deepeſt underſtanding; every ſoule under heaven, without form and void of God. As all things were then materially, as clay in the hands of the Potter, free for God to ſhape how he would, one to this, another to that; ſo are we now ſpiritually: and as then he was led in the old creation by his will, ſo is he now in the new creation, and by nothing elſe; the will of none interrupts or ſwayes a jot with God. <hi>Of his own will be begat us by the Word of truth,</hi> Jam. 1.18. Not any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God ſwayes him, in what he does in the old creation or in the new, and therefore all that comes forth from him is free, and can be no otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I will give you an argument more of this nature, and then the uſe of all; not a creature upon the face of the earth that can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent any thing of his own to God to draw love, and to make friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the leaſt kinde. Diſtance and diſparitie is ſo great between ſome perſons, that there is an utter incapacitie in one ſide, to make and ingage the other. What can a begger, a vagabond, preſent a Prince with, to make his favour, if he would be made with a gift. The caſe is ours; out of naught comes naught; we are naught and nothing elſe, and can preſent nothing elſe to him who is nothing but good. There is <hi>[no ſoundneſſe]</hi> in us, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. 'Tis a remarkable expreſſion, if we had any ſoundneſſe, and 'twere but very light, we might preſent that to attract and make friendſhip and love, and ſo with ſomething of our own, help by art a bad condition; but there is <hi>no ſoundneſſe in us</hi> from the crown of the head, to the ſole of the foot. What grace doth by degrees in a very long ſpace of time, that ſin did preſently. Grace doth purge wholly, but 'tis long firſt. <hi>The God of peace ſanctifie you [wholly]</hi> &amp;c.

                  </label> I have now ſhewed, you that mercy cannot be merited, but ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice may. The favour of God goes for nothing in man, but the wrath of God goes forth alwayes for ſomething in man: a courſe of ſin ſhould be trembled at: ah Lord, what will this bring about? My goodneſſe extends not to God, but my wickedneſſe doth. My grace merits nothing, but my ſin merits much. A man may doe enough to deſerve hell quickly. The troubles of the whole Land are many, every Country dyed with bloud; I know how folkes ſpeake of all this, yet not a drop of bloud more ſhed, then merited. If thy many wounds and much bleeding prove mortall, O <hi>England,</hi> thy death will be but juſt deſert. 'Twere well if what now is upon us, were all we have deſerved, we ſhould then give a gueſſe, when our troubles would end, whereas now we can give none. A perſon or Nation purſued according to merit, periſheth unavoydably. The wages of ſin is death: Our remedie is free mercy, that God breake off from what he is yet but entred upon, to wit, judgement; for if he goe on to doe but juſtice, woe unto us all, he will finde matter enough to keep juſtice alive, till every perſon in the Land be dead. See <hi>Eſa.</hi> 9. <hi>He ſhall ſnatch on the right hand, and be hungry, and he ſhall eate on the left hand, and not be ſatisfied; they ſhall eate every man the fleſh of his own arme, Manaſſeh Ephraim, and Ephraim Manaſſeh, &amp;c. And for all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is ſtretched out ſtill,</hi> verſ. 20, 21. Juſtice will finde worke a great while, if this be onely imployed about a people, 'twill eate out all and looke over the hatch for more. <hi>For all this his anger is not put away, &amp;c.</hi> When juſtice hath deſtroyed a whole Land, yet not a jot ſatisfied nor pacified, but ſtands ready to burne it againe and againe. Mercy finiſheth her worke, that conſummates the creature: juſtice finiſheth her worke too, and this conſumes the creature. When juſtice doth finiſh her worke, yet then 'tis righteous, 'tis <hi>in righteouſneſſe. He will finiſh his worke [in righteouſneſſe].</hi> If this be the determination of God upon us, that juſtice ſhall finiſh her work in the middeſt of us, we are in a conſumption, and can never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>He [will finiſh] his worke in righteouſneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> That's a fatall ſentence. If free grace intercept not, till juſtice hath finiſhed her
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:113418:138"/>
worke, 'twill eate us out all. Wee have deſerved to die all; beate at heaven, to know whether the heart of God be hardened as yours is, and whether he be onely judiciarily bent againſt us. <hi>And whom he will he hardens, &amp;c.</hi> Flint to flint, ſtrikes nothing but fire. God hardened and we hardened, nothing but blowes and fire, will or can iſſue out of this. Plead with God for grace and compaſſion for the Land, or we cannot live.</p>
               <p>More particularly, I would make application of this point. Grace is free in ſoule diſtreſſes, let us all feed upon this doctrine. God doth not chooſe us and imbrace us for our beautie, as <hi>Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuerus</hi> did <hi>Eſther,</hi> and yet this is it that makes many poore ſoules, to ſhake off what they ſhould take hold on. I am very filthy, preyed upon with this luſt or that, &amp; ſhould ſuch a one as I kiſſe the King of glory? Is there any reaſon to thinke, that he will take me into his armes, and make me his delight? Wee may not meaſure the wayes of God, by the wayes of man: Grace workes above reaſon, that which we can give no ground for, God doth: his love <hi>paſſeth knowledge,</hi> in the breadth, length, height, and depth of it, in the ſpring of it. Why is this man or that beloved? can any man give a ground, more then that which <hi>Paul</hi> doth? <hi>It [pleaſed] God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale his Son in me.</hi> Nothing can be rendered as a reaſon of Gods love to any thing, but to Chriſt; if any thing incite him towards us, 'tis that which deters us from him, to wit, our deſperate condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The poore man that lay wounded, when all paſſed by, Chriſt took compaſſion upon him. Grace doth ſo worke, as beſt to ſhew its own nature; the leſſe you ſee in your ſelves, the leſſe you can ſay for your ſelves, the likelier to find favour and friendſhip with God. Chriſt is come of purpoſe to make favour and friendſhip for ſuch, that ſee themſelves worthy of none. Let what will be ſaid of this nature, yet tempted ſoules will put all off: ſomething muſt be on my part, to get the favour of God, and I can doe nothing, I am under the power of darkneſſe, and cannot ſtirre a limbe: what can become of me but ruine? I cannot pray, nor heare, nor believe: yet thou maiſt be bleſſed. When we have no legs to goe forth to fetch in good things, they make legs to themſelves, and come to us. As <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of riches, that <hi>they make wings to themſelves, and flie away from us:</hi> ſo divine favours make wings and legs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and come to us. <hi>Salvation is come to thy houſe. Joy comes in the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:113418:138"/>
morning. I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you.</hi> The doctrine in hand anſwers this objection too, grace is in all points, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all circumſtances <hi>free.</hi> The <hi>preparations</hi> of the heart in man, and the <hi>anſwer</hi> of the tongue; what to thinke, what to ſay, what to doe, to make you bleſſed, you ſhall have all from the Lord. Poore creatures, at an utter loſſe in themſelves, conclude God is ſo too, otherwiſe why ſhould you give up your condition as deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate? When you can doe no more, can Chriſt doe no more, to ſet the wheele of mercy going? Yes he can, but he will not for mee. Why? Becauſe of this and that. This is all one to ſay, that his love is not fully free, which is a direct contradiction of the doctrine in hand. Grace hath riches in it, unſearchable riches, it workes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what you can aske, beyond what you can thinke; it blots out uncleanneſſe, bloud, guilt, treaſon againſt the higheſt State; <hi>grieving, quenching, reſiſting the holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this is to tempted Chriſtians; to men in their carnall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, a word more, and this diſcourſe will end. Your condition is not ſuppoſedly miſerable, but indeed ſo. You are not the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, you have <hi>not obtained mercy;</hi> and yet all this may be, becauſe grace is in all reſpects <hi>free.</hi> Conſcience though in a dead ſleepe, is ſtartled now and then, and then rages terribly; cuts and wounds, raves and teares, and then lies down againe, as your bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams doe; this is a wofull condition, and by ſo much the more wofull, becauſe ſuch pangs come and goe, and nothing done by them, but naked torment and deſpaire. Such diſtempers of ſoule, are much like thoſe diſtempers of body, which you call convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, falling ſickneſſe, it takes men by fits, upon changes of weather, condition, and the like: ſuch as are troubled with theſe fits, ſhould doe well to have in readineſſe ſuch Scriptures, as that 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Which in times paſt were not a people,</hi> which in times paſt had not <hi>obtained mercy,</hi> but now all is otherwiſe. And that Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 32.36. <hi>I will waſh you, and cleanſe you, but not for your ſakes.</hi> Though at preſent you are ſuch and ſuch ſinfull livers, you may have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Lord, and be changed. Diabolicall convulſions wry and wreſt your mouthes and eyes gaſtly againſt good, and make you foame at mouth againſt Chriſt, and yet as fearfully wicked as you are, you may obtaine mercy. The Apoſtle ſpeakes of ſuch a generation as theſe in the text; <hi>And yee which were enemies in your

Earth is the baſeſt Element, and yet out of this Chriſt makes a body, and doth by it the nobleſt things. The meane and low wayes that God goes in, to bring about the greateſt and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt workes, is wonderfull: he chooſeth weake things, and with theſe deſtroys ſtrong. Fleſh is weake, and with this he deſtroys ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the ſtrongeſt ſpirits, principalities, powers, all the enemies of our ſalvation: Yea he taketh things which are not, to bring to naught things which are. <hi>One is not,</hi> meaning <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which was ſlaine, and by this one which was not, by this deſpiſed perſon, were all the reſt made to ſtoop, yea by this one that was not, was all the reſt, father and children ſav'd. <hi>Joſeph</hi> was in this a type of Chriſt, by taking a body, a humane body, he was ſold into bondage, ſlaine; one that was not, and by this brought to nought things that are, ſin, Satan, hell, and made the way open to heaven, which was ſhut with everlaſting dores.</p>

Chriſt is the power of God, the <hi>great power of God,</hi> as they falſly ſaid of the Sorcerer, he can with his own hand worke ſalvation. That which can doe a thing alone, can doe it with a ſmall concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; if the hand be the hand of <hi>Sampſon,</hi> then whether a bone or feather be in that hand, 'tis all one, the worke intended, will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, <hi>Sampſon</hi> will be mortall to his enemies, and accompliſh his will, what ever inſtrument he workes by. The things wee uſe muſt contribute joyntly with us, to the worke we ſet upon, becauſe we are too weak for it, we take up no inſtrument, but wee borrow ſomething from it which we need, and therefore picke and chooſe when wee take up tooles, leſt we faile in our end. 'Tis not ſo with Chriſt, he takes up no inſtrument from neceſſitie, he is ſo compleat himſelfe, and therefore any thing that comes next to hand, a jaw-bone, a ſling, a nayle, a clod of earth, a body of fleſh like ours, weapon enough to overthrow all the powers of darkneſſe.</p>
               <p>'Tis no matter what the inſtrument be, ſo that it hath but the advantage of divine ordination to ſuch an end. All the means that God uſeth are effectuall to his end, becauſe he hath appointed them, and not for any cauſe or reaſon naturally in themſelves. If there be no likely power in an inſtituted means, yet it ſhall accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh its end, becauſe inſtituted. I am not aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, 'tis the power of God unto ſalvation. To ſpeak a few plain words of a deſpiſed perſon, and think by this to convert the ſouls of men from their wicked wayes, and to bring them to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to wave a lofty ſtrain of humane wiſdome, more likely to take, <hi>I am not aſhamed to do this;</hi> this courſe may ſeem folly, yet certainly it ſhall accompliſh its work, 'twill be the power of God to ſalvation, becauſe the will of God hath inſtituted it. That Chriſt ſhould have ſuch a frail inſtrument, and no other, to wit, a body of fleſh, a ſubſtance capable of death, to conquer death with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, was of Gods appointment; <hi>a body haſt thou prepared for me,</hi> and therefore effectuall to ſuch an end.</p>
               <p>God eyes himſelf in all he doth by us: He doth ſo order action and inſtrument, as may moſt advance his own glory. When the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is great, God is little; we cannot ſee much of Chriſt, when he takes up much of any thing here below to do his will by. Mans argumentation generally, is very deſtructive to the glory of God: That hand which is moſt viſible ſtill, that did all. <hi>Saul</hi> hath ſlain
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:113418:140"/>
his thouſand, <hi>David</hi> his ten thouſand, God none. God therefore leaves all which we ſo much look upon, and goes alone, and doth work with poor deſpiſed ones, which we caſt off. The Stone which the builders <hi>refuſed,</hi> he muſt be head: Weak and unlikely things to ſenſe, are trampled upon by us; Can death bring about heaven? Can baſe things bring about glory? Thus we reject and refuſe things, and then God uſes them, and then he is ſeen as God. The humanity of Chriſt was the fitteſt <hi>medium</hi> in the world, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Divinity of Chriſt by, to all the world. For ſuch an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan as ours to be made do mighty things, made beholders put that queſtion, What manner of man Chriſt was. We admire power, wiſdome, and every attribute elſe, when they put forth themſelves by poore and unlikely things, and not elſe. If means be likely to ſuch an end, according to our reaſon, we uſually never look at God, but bury the glory of all that is done, in inſtruments.</p>
               <p>Enemies to Chriſt ſhould tremble at this point. The kingdome of the Devill is ſtrong, men are confident and rage, Round-heads ſhall not live a man of them: God ſuddenly blaſt this pride with a little power. Men deſpiſed for valour and skill, God makes to drink the blood of deſpiſers, ſo he will do, 'tis his way. Great men, and great ſpirits, ſhould abaſe themſelves, if they will not, weak things, Worms, Flies, Frogs, ſhall devoure a king. The heart ſecretly riſeth, but the man is openly puld down; the ruine of the ſtout-hearted is very notorious by two circumſtances, in that it is done openly and utterly; that God uſeth weak means to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw ſtrong, and ſo, as never to riſe more: <hi>They ſank as a ſtone,</hi> ſaith the Text. Doth a ſtone riſe again? <hi>Jael</hi> nails <hi>Siſera</hi> to the ground, could he riſe again? Ah! what is become of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of the Lords enemies in this Land, which were mighty in battell? Are they not ſunk as a ſtone, pinned to the ground, gone to their center, to their place, whence they cannot return, and this by poor deſpiſed means? With weake inſtruments God doth through work: <hi>David</hi> ſtrikes down the <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> and that is not all, he is uſed to make ſure work with him, he runs and cuts off his head, which ſhadowed out the utter ruine of the kingdome of the Devill by Chriſt a deſpiſed man. God is upon a deſign the world will not believe; not a man ſhall ſtand before him that ſtands againſt him: <hi>The baiers of the Lord ſhall be deſtroyed,</hi> that is,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:113418:140"/>
all of them. If any ask how this ſhall be, becauſe things are ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely. I anſwer, The Lord <hi>creates evill;</hi> he can take any thing, a hailſtone, a wounded man, and form them into deadly inſtruments for his enemies. The fan in Chriſts hand, 'tis but a weak thing, a deſpiſed company, yet he will <hi>throughly purge</hi> his floore, he will out with all that offends. When ſome bad humors are let out, they gather and ſwell again, there is no end of action in an evill heart, till there be an utter end of the man. 'Tis ſad to behold, how ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies gather ino a head again, when blaſted from heaven; we ſhall prevaile, we ſhall prevaile. The Devill befools wiſe men; How can ye prevaile, and cannot conquer the weakneſſe of God? Poor weak things, if you cannot conquer an army of men, how will you conquer a legion of Angels? God hath a reſerve which you are not aware of; you chooſe out your ſtouteſt for a forlorn, but God his weakeſt, and yet theſe are too hard for you, and yet you feed your fancy, that you ſhall prevaile: The Devill is in this (would bloody wretches were aware of it,) that he may have all; he would not have a man ſit down in an evill way, till he come to his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end, which is Hell, the deſtruction of the body and ſoul.</p>
               <p>Chriſt hath many ſorts of enemies, all ſhould tremble at this point, that God doth great things with ſmall means. There is a corporall war, and a ſpirituall war in <hi>England,</hi> and both bloody, in both Chriſt will conquer, how weak, and poor, and deſpiſed ſoever his inſtruments be, which he uſeth. When Chriſt drew out a party to go out againſt the kingdome of the Devill, obſerve how he furniſhed him with munition: <hi>Go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and take neither ſword, nor ſtaffe, nor money,</hi> yet theſe carried it in the buſineſſe they went about. Externall advantages about internall works, are much lookt at, and much ſway with ſenſe: what power, what honour and wealth goes along with the wayes which are profeſt; Chriſt takes neither, and yet raiſeth up his Kingdome in the world; ſends out men not a whit ſeconded from ſecular advantage, no power from man, but the ſword of men againſt them; no honour from men, but the frownes of all againſt them, and yet turnes the world thus oppoſite, with two or three, upſide down. <hi>Theſe are they which turn the world upſide down.</hi> The world is a vaſt body, and holds very hard in its way, and yet this turned upſide down by two or three deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ones: Thus hath Chriſt done, thus doth Chriſt do, and thus

will he. Choller is a ſcurvie humor, it burns black mens throats and tongues. The Devill hath ſhot thouſands in the mouth, if not in the heart, in this war, between Presbyterians and Independants. O how wickedly do ſome good men talk now! and yet Chriſt will live, and every tittle of his will ſhall live, though bad and good ſhoot at it. Satan hath as large an army in the field now, as ever was known, bad men, good men; Satan is got into <hi>Judas,</hi> yea, and he is got into <hi>Peter,</hi> Maſter, drive gently, drive warily, ſave your skin, and avoid the bloody cup, and yet Chriſt will be too hard for both. Chriſt wants wit, and wants learning, and many things elſe, in the eyes of ſtanders by, and yet though ſo weak, conquers: God hath choſe, the <hi>fooliſh things</hi> of the world, to confound the wiſe.</p>
               <p>God ſhould be honoured in his way: the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> breaks forth ſweetly into bleſſing God from this ground, that God out of the mouth of <hi>babes,</hi> ſhould ordain ſtrength. And ſo <hi>Deborah</hi> notes it in her ſong, ſpecially and ſweetly, how <hi>Jael</hi> a <hi>woman,</hi> did a mans work, and uſed a mans inſtrument <hi>She put her hand to the nail, and her righ hand to the [work-mans] hammer.</hi> Women are uſuall very aucherd at mans work, left-handed, but <hi>Jael</hi> is right-handed at it, <hi>ſhe put her right hand,</hi> &amp;c. and that which was a work-mans ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is now a work-womans hammer, and ſhe bleſſes God, and extols him, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

Certainly, we of this Land are very much behinde hand with God, in honouring and praiſing of him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this admirable way of working. Things that are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, you will loſe none of them, you ſave the very duſt of gold. The manifeſtations of God, are the moſt precious things in all the world; the very duſt of Gods feet, in every path of his, we ſhould carefully keep, <hi>we ſhould talk of all his doings,</hi> how much more therefore of his wonderfull doings, when he doth much with nothing, and much for nothing, for worſe then nothing, to wit, ſinfull man. How God goes in the Sanctuary, and how he goes out of the Sanctuary, in the family, in the city, in the countrey, in the army, upon what weak legs, and with what little toes, ſhould

be all written down in the heart firſt, and then carried up to heaven for God to reade. Our father loves to have his children brought home to him often, to ſee them and their Nurſe, how well they proſper together. You cannot preſent God with a more ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſight in all the world, then with one of his own actions, with its ſpeciall circumſtances. They were under the Law, to lay their hand of the head of ſome offerings, that was to point out Chriſt, on whom they truſted. Bring an offering to God, any action of God with its ſpeciall circumſtances, and you lay your hand on the head of the offering, you point out Chriſt to all the world, as he whom you truſted on in your way, and as he whom you would have all elſe, to do the like, and on none elſe, and this is very ſweet to God, he loves to lie high in the breaſt of all. God hath done things in <hi>England</hi> ſo, me thinks, as to be crowned for ever in every <hi>Engliſh</hi> heart: by a very noiſe amongſt the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berry trees, he makes the mighty run and fall: <hi>Not by might, nor by power, but my Spirit,</hi> ſaith God. 'Tis by how much God gains in your hearts, that you are to meaſure his love to you in his works. With little God doth much for you, if with much you do little for him, in ſpeaking of him, and living to him, all will end ſadly at laſt. If nothing will ſet an inſtrument in tune, you break it and burn it, this makes me feare our ſtate in the midſt of hope: God is very good to thee <hi>England,</hi> but thou continueſt very bad, dead inwardly, dead ſpiritually, which according to reaſon, one would think, ſhould make death corporally.</p>
               <p>Finally, this way of God ſhould be truſted in; or this God, which can thus work, ſhould be firmly reſted on. When extremities are great, and little means appearing, then our hearts ſink; now miſery is mortall, but of our own making, for 'tis all one with God, to ſave with few, as with many. Nothing kills the man, ſo long as faith keeps alive, and faith can never die, if the ſoul well conſider the point in hand, that any thing is enough for God to work ſalvation by. I am much in debt, but a little oile in the cruce left. God can bleſſe a little, to riſe to a ſubſiſtance, and to diſcharge off all ingagements. A little of God is enough to make one very rich, very ſtrong, very wiſe, very bleſſed in all conditions, let mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery be as much as 'twill. Some are diſheartened from duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe oppoſites before them are many, viſible advantages very few,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:113418:142"/>
theſe ſoules lie inſnared in their own devices, and dye at a diſtance from God, which they have ſet themſelves, to keepe their body ſafe: with a little light and an honeſt heart, God can enable to doe much, to fight with the Prince of darkneſſe, very learned heads, and very malicious hearts. Did not God inable many poore wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and illiterate men, to befoole the bloudy Clergie of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages of the world, and to hold faith and a good conſcience, in deſpight of all? Were not them we read of in the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> out of <hi>weakneſſe made ſtrong;</hi> and the point in hand tells us, that this is the way of God. Reſolution ſhould carry on to dutie, and then let God alone to carry on in it, how weake ſoever you are, or how ſtrong ſoever your enemies are. A great dore was opened to <hi>Paul,</hi> and there were many enemies at it, he but one and weake, and yet along he would, and venter upon Chriſt, to make way through them, which makes one weake one, ſtronger then a thouſand.</p>

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:113418:142"/>
whence wee were digd. Affections follow ſenſe: where nothing makes impreſſion, there can be no compaſſion. Wee are dead in treſpaſſes and ſin: dead folkes conſider not who mourne for them, who die with griefe for them. Faculties hardened, the childe will throw aſide what the mother which bore him, underwent; the pangs, the ſcreeches, the teares of her that traveld in birth with him. Abilitie to dutie, ſprings not ſo much from things without, as from things within: as the ſoule is diſpoſed, not as the man is ingaged, ſo the partie moves. I will demonſtrate to you, that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to this dutie of being throughly and kindly affected, with what others undergoe for us, is hardly attain'd.</p>
               <p>It ſprings from goodneſſe purely contemplated; this is a very high thing to doe. Such a one did much for me, I did as much for him, or I may doe. If ſuch be out in fleſh, I am in purſe. Now is others goodneſſe kild with our owne; now is not the love of God, nor the love of man thought of, and how is it poſſible that either ſhould be beautifull in my eye: In ſuch a ſpirit, love hath her wings cut, and no matter to worke upon, which is that that gives diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the ſoule, to keepe him alive for ever in my breaſt, which hath done any good for me. We can doe nothing for Chriſt, nor his people, and yet all that is done for us by either, we thinke to be deſerved. 'Tis certain, that infinite love moulders to nothing in our breaſt, under the notion of our owne merit, one way or other, though we obſerve it not. If a man loſe his ſtate, his arme, his life for me, if I thinke he was bound to it by any thing of mine, the life of the action dyes, the memory of the man and his kindneſſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live long: Not an act that Chriſt doth, but we daſh it to death, againſt ſome induſtry of our own. That any creature loves me, is all love: that any one ſhews mercy to me, whether God or man, 'tis all mercy. I am vilder then the earth, below all deſert, deſire, as far as hell is below heaven: a heart at this height, ſtoopes and takes up kindneſſe fully, ſweetly, and keepes it in memory firmely. Things taken up as meere love, ſtick; otherwiſe not: This is a high and hard thing. I may inſtance this to you in God; he merits eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing at our hands we doe, and more then we can doe, and yet he takes up all under the notion of kindneſſe and love, and this makes him to remember all we doe, and all we ſuffer, exactly. <hi>I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the kindneſſe of thy youth, and the love of thine eſpouſalls.</hi> All is
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:113418:143"/>
kindneſſe and love, which man ſhews to God. <hi>And when I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, yee did [give] me this, and give me that;</hi> God looking upon all that we doe for him as <hi>gift,</hi> and as <hi>kindneſſe,</hi> this makes him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it alwayes; 'tis hard to get to that pitch, which God moves at.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It ſprings from love, ſtrongly warm'd; the heart muſt lie very neere God, which hath this benefit: God hath but few that lie neere him. Things of life, will not live in a dead ſea: the acts of God which he doth, they are very lively, and yet theſe will die, if the ſoule be not ſuitable which obſerves them. Every degree of divine life, is not enough to keepe favours done for us ſo divinely alive, as they ſhould be. 'Tis more then hinted in the text. Theſe <hi>Coloſſians</hi> had their Chriſtian life, but yet not ſo, as to remember the love of Chriſt, to the life: alas, who have! 'Tis hard to melt ſome things, much fuell, much blowing and paines uſed, and yet all this muſt be, to diſpoſe the matter, fitly to receive a laſting ſtamp and forme upon it. A heart melted with love, layes to heart the leaſt paines and kindneſſe ſhew'd to it. <hi>Whence is this, to me, that the mother of my Lord ſhould come to me, ſaid Elizabeth to Mary.</hi>

                  </label> As our hearts are below any duty, it ſhould humble us, but as they are below things which are very weighty, it ſhould humble us much more. The doctrine in hand, beats hard upon us for melting hearts. Chriſt ſuffers much for us, man ſuffers much for us, but neither conſidered by us. What any Chriſtian ſuffers for you, you are to account it as Chriſt ſuffering, he makes men willing to die for you; to preach themſelves dead, to pray themſelves dead, to fight themſelves dead; and all theſe dyings, the dyings of the Lord Jeſus. O that there ſhould be ſo many perſons, bleeding in the fields for us, and ſo few hearts bleeding at home for them, and for our ſelves! The ſtrokes of God are various; they are moſt mortall which kill the ſoule. Our bodies are turned to duſt apace, and our ſoules into ſtones as faſt. Ah Lord! how brawnie, how bowelleſſe, how hard-hearted is <hi>England</hi> become, ſince a ſeate of war! Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands loſe armes, legs, lives abroad, and wife and children let ſtarve at home. Our war is very bloudy: conſcience in every man ſlaine: not a tender heart ſcarce amongſt us, to conſider the condition of the greateſt ſufferers for us in the Land. <hi>Naball</hi> had his eaſe at home, his quarters quiet and plentifull; but what <hi>David</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:113418:143"/>
abroad, to make it ſo at home, did not move, did not, nor would not <hi>Nabal</hi> conſider. 'Tis your caſe, <hi>Londoners:</hi> During all theſe bleeding times, Chriſt hath been Quarter-maſter for you, and ſo appointed your quarters, that you have been very quiet, very bleſſed in peace and plenty; but what your brethren undergoe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, to procure all this for you at home, which of you doth lay to heart? <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> refuſed reſt and ſolace at home, becauſe of the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and hardſhip, which the Armies of the Lord were in abroad. The backes and bellies of thouſands of you, ſpeake no ſuch thing: Ah Lord! what will cure the pride and wantonneſſe of this wicked Citie! Drunkenneſſe and ſurfeiting now? Can you laugh when your brethren mourne, and when God frownes? yee Epicures, Can yee drinke wine in bowles, and the bloud of your brethren in bowles? You ſhould at all your exorbitant meetings, thus ſet fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at worke; The cup at my noſe, is the bloud of the ſlaine: My curious napkins and table-clothes, are the skins of Chriſtians: my gueſts the ghoſts of the ſlaine: my mad laſcivious ſongs, the groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, gaſpings, and ſhreechings of the wounded and dying. Canſt thou not thinke thus, when thou art in the midſt of thy jovall ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety? O, no; 'twould ſpoyle all my mirth, 'twould be like the hand-writing on the wall, to <hi>Belſhaſar.</hi> Doſt thou tender more the ſpoyling of thy carnall mirth, then the ſpoyling of thy eternall ſoule? The guilt of all the bloud that is ſlaine, will fall upon thee, as an unſenſible ſoule. Hadſt thou rather howle for ever, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare mad-mirth a little while? If thou wilt not turne ſinful mirth into mourning, God will turne it into howling. God loves not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, yet what he is exemplarily eminent in, he cannot endure that men ſhould altogether ſlight. God layes to heart all that we undergo for him; <hi>in all our afflictions, he is afflicted:</hi> ſo ſhould we lay to heart, all that he and his undergoe for us. 'Tis the grand medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of converſion, this that I touch: What will melt the heart, if that love which bleeds to death for us, be forgotten. Sinners, Chriſt hath ſuffered the wrath of God for you; he left more wealth then this world is worth, and became poore; he left a manſion in glory, and took a body of fleſh, a houſe of clay, and in this houſe dyed, and left you all, that you might live for ever in the fruition of all. Is all this nothing? Will you regard your ſinnes, more then this Chriſt? Shall your luſt live, though Chriſt have dyed? The death
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:113418:144"/>
and bloud of the Lord Jeſus, will be upon you. Can you looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pierced Chriſt, and not mourne? He will ſhew you your owne hardneſſe of heart, in a like carriage; he will looke upon the wounds and torments of your conſciences, in the houre when you make your will, and not be affected. When mercy cannot bring forth, juſtice becomes the mid-wife, and this cryes ſave the womb, ſave the womb, let what will become of the childe; if this childe die, and bee puld to pieces between the legges, yet another may live, if the womb be preſerved. God much eyes the meanes he uſes to doe us good, he will preſerve the honour of theſe, though thouſands die which trample upon them. What Chriſt hath ſuffered for us, ſhall gain and ſave thouſands, though it deſtroy you; though you lay not Chriſts love to heart, yet Chriſt will have a great many to do it: <hi>When I am lifted up, I will draw all men unto me.</hi> Chriſt makes means, and then bleſſeth them to their end; men eye not this, and ſo die without the benefit of them. What Chriſt hath ſuffered for us; he hath promiſed ſo to order, as to make it drawing and winning of us; that his lifting up upon the croſſe, and from thence to heaven; ſhall lift up our ſouls from ſins, and from thence to him, and to the place where he is. Theſe words ſhould be believingly urged, and then the work of our welfare would go on an end. As mercy ſtoops loweſt, it takes up us; for God to make means and bleſſe them, is mercy ſtooping very low, to take up them that are quite down.</p>

                  </label> What God means in all this, ſhould be inquired into. What every carnall thing dying, and yet carnall affection alive? There is demonſtration enough without, of the mortality of all things, but no demonſtration of this within us; <hi>our inward thoughts are, that our habitation ſhall indure for ever. England</hi> all over is a demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this point, that all things are bleeding and dying. Chriſt had rather that a thouſand thouſands of bodies ſhould die, then one
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:113418:145"/>
ſoul: one thing is aimed at, that all things die, to wit, the death of your luſt, the life of faith; and this is your leſſon from this Doctrine. Can you receive it? Every thing ſhall live for ever, when you can love all in Chriſt, and admire all in Chriſt, and make an advantage of love by all, to Chriſt. All the ruines you behold in this kingdom, or in the whole creation, all the ſeas of blood wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the world is at this day, are but to waſh our hearts; that's very foul, which muſt have all without, even Chriſt himſelf turn'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to blood, to cleanſe it. 'Tis long ere carnall affections be ſlain; every thing muſt die, and its blood be thrown in the face of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ere the man will ſpit out what offends God. The ſtability of all about you, bears much upon the rectitude of your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Take heed how you love husband, wife, children, you may hug them to death with a ſinfull love: You complain of Cavalleers for killing your eſtates, trades, friends, but your own luſt did all this ſpoile; could the Word, or any leſſer rod have killed your affection to the world, the good things thereof would have been all alive, and in your hand at this day.</p>
               <p>Poore Chriſtians ſhould cheare themſelves from this point. Thou haſt nothing in this world, no wealth, no honours, no friends; thy gay clothing, is thy skin; thy lands, thy hands; thy wealth, thy health; 'twill be the caſe of all; all is dying, to them that have it: naked came every one out of the wombe, and naked ſhall they thither return; every thing ſhall die from him that hath moſt: thou wilt have as much in the grave, as he that hath moſt out. The rich and the poor ſhake hands in the duſt. There is danger in rich mens joy, and poor mens ſorrow, about worldly things; The Doctrine in hand would cure both, if ſtudied well; that all dies, me thinks, ſhould make one not love much what one had, nor grieve much for what one has not, but in both, to look out after another ſtate.</p>
               <p>All things are dying here, but all things are ever living and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting above, O that I were there! Were I in heaven, I ſhould heare no more knels, nor paſſing-bels, no noiſe of warre. In the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of Chriſt, all is quiet; there be a great many there, and yet they do not fight, nor kill one another, nor never wil. They are <hi>rivers of pleaſure,</hi> which they drink of above; many going to drink at a river, fall not out, becauſe there is water enough, and ſpace

enough; but many thirſty creatures going to a bottle to drink, fight and pull it out of one anothers hand; I cannot drink, ſaith one, 'twill be all drunk up, ſaith another; ſuch a one drinks ſo much: none of all theſe complaints when perſons drink at a river, though thouſands there, they drinke all together quietly, becauſe a river is a large cup, and hath ſprings at bottome: ſo is the breaſt of Chriſt, 'tis a river of pleaſure, yea 'tis rivers of pleaſure; thouſands and thouſand of thouſands drink there all together, and no falling out, for want of convenience to drinke, or for feare of want of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe there be ſprings at bottome. 'Twere better to enjoy theſe things, then talke of them, one can but ſpeake ſo brokenly of them.</p>

The object of divine preſentation is God: All preſents under the Law, they were brought before the Lord, but the goat, which was the ſcape goat, was <hi>preſented alive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord,</hi> Levit. 16.10. Preſents of this nature, are our homage, wherein we lively teſtifie who is the Lord of all, which is none but God: their offerings under the Law, they were a certain tenth of ſeverall kinds, and theſe of the beſt, and theſe brought to the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, or tent of Gods preſence, for divine acknowledgement: ſo 'tis at this day. All is ours, onely a certain tenth of the beſt, to wit, the heart, muſt be brought to the Tabernacle of preſence, <hi>(i)</hi> to God, and to Heaven, and preſented to him. <hi>My ſonne give me thy heart.</hi>

Wee have many things given unto us, to play the ſpirituall artiſt with them, to make jewels and bracelets, odors and crownes, and to put them all upon God, and upon him onely, to advance his ſtate: as the choiceſt things that could be got in all the holy Land, or any where elſe, farre or neare, were for the Prince of <hi>Judah,</hi> and for him one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to raiſe his ſtate and glory: which was a type of Chriſt, who is the glory of all the earth, who is a King higher then the Kings of

                  <hi>Judah,</hi> higher then the Kings of the Gentiles, higher then <hi>Agag.</hi> Divine preſentation is adoration, adoration is proper to God, and proper to Chriſt onely as God; as he ſits upon the throne, mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the greatneſſe of the God-head in the world, ſo crownes are brought and laid at his feete.</p>
               <p>The object of divine preſentation may be conſidered as more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant or leſſe diſtant, leſſe viſibly or more viſibly preſent; as 'tis held out in the text to be conſidered, 'tis to be conſidered under the moſt immediate notion, as preſents are made to him above. Perſons and actions are oft preſented to God in way of dutie here, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Chriſt; hereafter both ſhall be brought before God in way of office, onely by Chriſt, we being wholly paſſive. Chriſt ſhall appeare firſt, and then all that are in him; Chriſt as Mediator pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents himſelfe firſt, and then we are preſented by him. <hi>Here am I, and the children which thou haſt given me.</hi> This preſentation ſhall be made very accurately, every perſon and action; every act externall, to a cup of cold water; every act internall, every good thought ſhall be laid open before God, every good purpoſe, that we would have built a houſe for God, and that we would have done this and that, ſhall be preſented before God as done: all good intentions, and the perſon that hath them; the perſons ſhall be preſented, as the perſon of Chriſt, &amp; his intentions, as the very actions of Chriſt; as perfect in both as Chriſt, in his perſon and life; ſo as the Father and Chriſt are one, Chriſt and we ſhall be one, and ſo be imbraced for ever. We ſhall be preſented to God, ſo one with Chriſt, as a wife is one with her husband, as a chaſte Spouſe without ſpot; through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one in love with our husband, and ſo fully one in priviledge.</p>
               <p>The properties of this preſentation are theſe:</p>
               <p>'Tis very ſolemne; God, all the Saints and glorious Angels of Heaven, beholders of it. Things are very publikely carried above, Jewels are not ſecretly given and hanged in the breaſt, as Chriſt doth here; every ones inſtalment is with all the traine and ſtate of Nobles in bliſſe, every ones preſentation is matter of a new ſong, and all the quire of heaven have it in their mouths preſently, not one ſits ſad and mute, as unacquainted with the matter, when the reſt ſing; every preſent is opened, all the myrrhe ſeene and ſmelt, by every one above, and ſo all ſing at once, as equally revived, and reviving the reviver. Every preſentation brings new acts of God;
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:113418:147"/>
not a ſoule that is ſet before God by Chriſt, but peculiar wayes of love and workings of Gods grace found in him, and all theſe laid open before God, and all the Saints and Angels in heaven, and ſet to ſeverall ſongs, for all the quire of heaven to ſing unto all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie. There is joy in heaven, at the turning home, and coming in of a ſinner, that is, in this lower heaven, to wit, the kingdome of grace; all the Saints rejoyce exceedingly, as any one comes into God, as a ſhadow of that which is gloriouſly done above. O if a man could but ſee what a ſmiling heaven that above is all over, when any ſoule is brought and ſet downe before God, by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt!</p>
               <p>'Tis an eternall act. Where the ſoule is ſet by Chriſt when it goes hence, there it abides for ever. The things which God doth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, are eternall; he bleſſeth, and curſeth for ever: to whom the ſoule is preſented hereafter, there it abides for ever; ſoules that are ſet before Satan, there they abide for ever; and ſuch as are ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, there they abide for ever, to behold the glory of his countenance. God when he hath his children brought home, he puts them out no more, he gives them their inheritance, and this lies all before him, and there they ſit down upon it, and feed upon the ſweet of it for ever. 'Tis a large inheritance that every one hath above, and yet it doth not occaſion any that are brought before God, to be placed far off from him; Manſions and thrones are all prepared, and they lie all before Gods throne, and ſtand as long as his; the windows were open towards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe there was Gods preſence; ſo every ones manſion is ſo prepared and ſhaped, that the windows all open towards God, they can fit in their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of reſt above, and look God full in the face. <hi>Bleſſed are they that ſtand before thee, they alwayes behold thy face,</hi> ſaid that royall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it hints one ſtate above, and rather ſpeakes that, then this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Bleſſed, yea bleſſed indeed are they that ſit before the Lord for ever, which ſit in ſtate as Kings, even as <hi>Solomon</hi> himſelf, which ſit upon thrones for ever, as that greater then <hi>Solomon</hi> doth, which are joynt in concurrence in all acts of ſtate, and triumph together for ever, that where one goes tother goes, and ſo <hi>ever with the Lord,</hi> ever before the Lord. Your laſt houſe, your laſt habit, your laſt condition, hath no ſhadow of change; not a thought that any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of felicitie ſhall waſte and end, ſo much as enters into any ſoule

before the Lord, that they ſhall ever be ſet one haires breadth out of their place.</p>

Precious things are in ſome Countries, but not knowne by the Inhabitants, they are ſo brutiſh, and ſo not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, but trampled upon; 'tis ſo all this world over, in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſenſe. A brutiſh ſpirit poſſeſſeth this world, ſo that perſons know not the jewels and treaſures which lie hid in the bowels of it. There is ſuch a precious metall amongſt the earth and rubbiſh of this world, that ſhines into heaven, that may make a rich and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable preſent, to the great State above, did the world ſee it: their blindneſſe is their plague; &amp; 'tis miſery enough, one would not wiſh them more, what ever one undergoes by them. I am tender of you the Lords people; I know you meet with much evill from evill men, let nothing ſadden nor imbitter you; ſtill conſider what you are in the eye of God, what ever in the eye of man: let not the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe of evill men, make you loſe your own ſweetneſſe: ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how precious you are, and to whom you ſhall be preſented for ever. The very influence of heaven, is enough for ſome choice creatures to live upon; ſome ſweet dewes that fall, the Bees picke out of it a ſweet ſtock, and doe well, although theſe dewes fall but now and then: ſo ſome influences of the higheſt heaven, of that ſtate and condition we ſhall have; choice ſpirits me thinkes might live well upon, and wade ſtrongly through all tryals here, though they have theſe influences but now and then; if wee did but pick up the crums from the Table above, if we did but conſider where we ſhall be, and what we ſhall be, we ſhould rejoyce in tribulation; 'twas a ſweet diſh to the prodigall, when he was eating huskes, to thinke what food was in his fathers houſe, though he could not tell whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he ſhould be admitted thither. The world gives us husks and
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:113418:148"/>
bones to feed on, we may fetch a diſh from heaven to mend the matter well enough, if wee be ſo wiſe and ſo heavenly as wee ſhould be.</p>
               <p>We are the ruine of our own life: 'tis hard to get thoughts high enough. Preſent things are the things onely to be minded, we muſt minde this, and we muſt minde it thus, ſo we neceſſitate our minds, and marre all. What muſt I onely thinke of <hi>Shimei</hi> that curſes? Muſt I onely thinke of povertie? and onely thinke of ſickneſſe that is upon me? What neceſſitie of this? There is no neceſſitie of this, but yet I cannot doe otherwiſe. Wouldſt thou doe otherwiſe? No; I would not do otherwiſe. How canſt thou be remedied then? Some are married to a <hi>Blackmore,</hi> and will not be divorced; to black melancholy ſpirits and humors, &amp;c. which they love and will not heare to part with. <hi>Rachel will not be comforted.</hi> There is nothing to be ſaid to theſe ſpirits, till their burdens have more bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and humbled them.</p>
               <p>Others are more ripened and mellowed by the rod, to whom my queſtion is, Would you have your thoughts taken off from thinking ſo much of your calamitie? Would you have your ſoules thinke much, what you ſhall be, and where you ſhall be? O yes, rather then any thing in the world. The mercy is neare, yea very neare, which you thirſt after. <hi>Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.</hi> Hungring, longing, and praying, this is opening the mouth wide: believe it, the Lord Jeſus is at hand, he hath ſent his <hi>Prodromoi,</hi> his forerunners, to lay in ſome proviſion; he will ſup with you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and feaſt with you anon, and then all will be well, the ſoule ſtrong, and as high and as noble as its work. Our ſtrength to high duty, is from full preſence, and full communion; The choiceſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to get this, you ſhould carefully uſe, which would doe much in tother world, which would be much above, and before him where you ſhall ever be. Some workes have a great deale of heaven in them, reade them: ſome perſons have a great deale of heaven in them, look out and read them: ſome ordinances have a great deale of heaven, obſerve them. There is a great deale of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in ones ſtanding, to look a great way.

The beſt people have one too many ſtill at their table, though they are not aware of him, and he drops ſomething ſtill into every diſh to curdle and ſower it in their ſoules, how ſweet and precious ſoever in its own nature. When the words of Chriſt wound, Satan then drops in gall and vineger, to turne convictions into deſpaire; when they comfort, he ſophiſticates and makes the doctrine of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie, a <hi>medium</hi> to forget piety: this in ſome words of this text is hinted, in others prevented. Heaven lengthens out a holy life to all eternitie, it doth ſo in its proper nature; 'tis a laying of our ſoules in his boſome, who hath us but by the hand here: 'tis not in it ſelf, nor under any conſideration to end grace here, or hereafter, but to conſummate it. <hi>If you continue,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Through abiding of, or in the faith,</hi> is the firſt thing that we are to ſtand upon. By faith is meant the Goſpel, as is explained in the next clauſe, Chriſt as revealed in his Word. Truth hath a latitude within and without it ſelf; the obſervation of both is a through purſuit. Truth hath a latitude within it ſelf, that is, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of it; 'thas many precepts, and all theſe their proper extent. <hi>Thy commandements are exceeding broad:</hi> The Goſpel hath many rules directory, many conſolatory; when the ſoul ſets before it ſelf all as a rule of life, then doth it <hi>throughly abide in the faith; then are you my Diſciples, if you do whatſoever I command you.</hi> The whole boſome of Chriſt is the ſeat of the ſoul hereafter, and the whole will of Chriſt, is the ſeat of the ſoul here; when the ſoul doth not make it ſo, it is wanton and wilfull, and doth not throughly abide in the faith. Chriſt had a materiall garment when materially preſent, and it had many threads, but all weaved into one web and robe, without ſeam or ſigne of one: ſo Chriſt now ſpiritually preſent, hath likewiſe a ſpirituall garment of like form. The Goſpel hath many rules, when all theſe are weaved together by a Chriſtian in his life, and made a ſpirituall robe of ſtate for the glory of Chriſt, and not one thread left out, when the ſoul doth put on all Chriſt, and clothes himſelf with him from head to feet, then doth he throughly abide in the faith.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Truth hath a latitude without it ſelf; 'tis to live as long as we. We are to be faithfull to the death, ſo in every truth; no truth is ſhort lived, to laſt a ſeaſon only, as 'tis ſaid of them, <hi>they rejoyced in his light for a ſeaſon:</hi> if we make any truth ſhort lived for any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation whatſoever, we abide not throughly in it.

The obſervation of Gods will ſimply conſidered, never ceaſes; they in heaven do Gods will, and are propoſed as our pattern on earth, they are ſo exact in the obſervation of it; but the painfull obſervation of Gods will, which is by reaſon of corruption within us, and wicked ſpirits

without us, this ceaſes as ſoon as we ſtep out of this vile body, but not before. They move to Chriſt above, as Chriſt doth to them, with the ſame ſpirit of freedome, joy, triumph, and glory. <hi>That they may be one as we are.</hi> There is no ſighing and groaning, mourning, dying, to accompliſh Gods will above, all move there as the Angels, with delight; every one milks out love from the breaſts of Chriſt, and ſings over the Pail, to behold how full 'tis, and how free it comes; and yet, though it coſt all theſe to obey any truth of God here, we are not to ceaſe our courſe. Every childe is brought forth with pain, but ſome with more then others, it coſts life to bring forth ſome, yet it's horrible wickedneſſe for any to ſtrangle the birth, to prevent the pain. <hi>Benjamin</hi> muſt be born, though it coſt <hi>Rachel</hi> her life.

Heaven and Gods will, are linked together, break the link, if it be but one link, and the jewel falls, and is loſt. Heaven is a Jewel, hanged in a golden chain, break one link of the golden chain, and you loſe the Jewel: 'Tis nothing to deſperate ſouls to make void Gods Law; I wonder at them; Is it nothing to loſe heaven? to untwiſt the golden chain upon which your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall treaſure hangs? Tranſgreſſion ſtupifies, this is the killing quality of ſin. Sinners mind not what they do, when they throw off the will of Chriſt, any part of the will of Chriſt, you throw away your life.

thy <hi>Laodicean</hi> temper, that thou thinkeſt thou art clean, and art not waſhed from thy filthineſſe; that thou needeſt nothing, and yet obſerveſt nothing Euangelically, that looks like a lovely State. Our point ſets us too high a great deal, to ſpeak to this generation; it calls for exact obſervation, and we are by the hand of God upon us; caſt into the quite contrary, a generation that had a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but now have none. Looſneſſe and lewdneſſe overſpread the multitude, brawnineſs and benummedneſs the more ingenious; good men become bad, bad ſtark naught, and ſtink above ground. 'Tis worſe then blood and death, to heare and ſee in every place where one comes, what mire and dirt our troubled waters caſt up, as if war were a ticket under Gods own hand to diſpence with all wickedneſſe. O the oaths, the execrations, whoredoms, oppreſſions, outrages of all ſorts, that the very highwayes and villages are filled with where ever one comes! The ſtink of your camps, enough to kill a good heart, at a great diſtance. 'Tis ſad, that the blood and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the dead, ſhould taint and poiſon the living; that we ſhould die ſwearing and blaſpheming. If there be any tender hearts among you, carry theſe things home, and mourn, for I am fearfull what they preſage.</p>
               <p>The work of this point is not only to winde you off from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe, but wind you up to exactneſſe, to through walking with Chriſt. We halt; the fruit of it is upon us, the hand of God will not yet cure it, what it may, Chriſt only knowes. The heart muſt have its latitude, 'tis every ones ſaying this. To hit the white, is not needfull; one may ſhoot well, that doth not this. But can one ſhoot well that aimes not at this? <hi>I preſſe towards the mark, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what is behinde, if by any means I may obtain the reſurrection.</hi> Here is the property of grace in life, it owns nothing but perfection; makes at nothing elſe; 'tis in aim and induſtry all Chriſts.

the ſoul waſts its ſtrength: If there be any intenſe through action now on foot, it lies here, ſo to ſhape the courſe and poſture to the right and left, that the man may take in all worldly advantages of both ſides, along as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

There is much advange in this, but it comes to nothing: the plague of an hypocrite is upon this condition, which will eat a man out, if he had all the world: There is more of heaven in a plain heart in a moment, then this man ſees in all his dayes. The advantage of through action is this:</p>
               <p>A man gets much of Chriſt, much grace, much glory. Some mens religion is a principle of jugling with conſcience and the world, 'tis a temptation upon thouſands at this day; theſe loſe what they ſeem to have, Chriſt and all grace quite: Chriſt kicks off every <hi>Judas</hi> quite, that kiſſeth him, and kiſſeth enemies to him too, for his own advantage: but a ſoul that cleaves throughly to Chriſt, hath much of him, the diſpenſations of Angels. <hi>Stephen</hi> ſhined like an Angel, owning Chriſt in the face of deadly and bloody oppoſers. Externall diſpenſations cannot be ſtood upon; how Chriſt appears to honour the perſons of men, that will go to the grave with him, is more uncertain; they have the face, the tongue and the food of Angels, when it may do them good, and torture devils that vex them. Externall concurrence is ſure for the thing, though uncertain for the manner: Chriſt doth <hi>number our haires,</hi> at all times: but what doth he do then when the head is going to be cut off? He doth make all our darkneſſe light, that which is upon nature, ſtate, perſon. Chriſt is with us alwayes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to an externall goodneſſe, one way or other. They have Roſemary and Bays, or ſome ſweet thing or other in their hand, in the view of all, that go to the grave with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But internally they have much of him indeed, that cleave cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him. What a box of raviſhing odors did Chriſt open to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> ſoul, which did perfume his body and go along with him to his grave? Can any one explain the depth of divine love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with her ſoul was filled? That was heaven in hell: What's hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? but the love of Chriſt without meaſure, powred into the heart. To hearten on <hi>Abraham</hi> to follow the commands of God throughly, to forſake <hi>Chaldea, Babel,</hi> and all the confuſion of a blind

Through action makes through reception: through action is a ſoul giving up all to Chriſt, againſt all oppoſition from men. When we give all to Chriſt, hee gives all to us; and what a deal is Chriſts all? I have <hi>all,</hi> ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> when he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for Chriſts ſake, All: What all? A divine all. When you ſpeak of your all, <hi>(i.)</hi> of all you have, it riſes ſometime to a great deal, to many thouſands; but what Arithmetick will expreſſe Chriſts all?

Some hold not on, others wil never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin good, this is the plague of a blind ſoul. God unknown, is bid to depart: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Chriſt unknown, is bid to leave the coaſts, to give place to Swine: the ſweeteſt wayes of Chriſt unknown, men will never ſet foot in them. The <hi>Levites</hi> Concubine lay forced to death, and <hi>her hands,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>lay upon the threſhold of the door,</hi> Judg. 19.27. ſo do many ſouls; Satan forces them to death, at the door <hi>of good;</hi> their hands, as it were upon the threſhold of Gods Houſe, ſo neer entring in, and yet there Satan, with one wile or other, forces them to death. Ignorance generates prejudice, and now you ſhall ſee a blind man fencing to keep off Chriſt and ſalvation from coming to his houſe. 'Twould make a mans ſoul bleed, to heare, with what weak things many ignorant hearts are kept off from making ſo much as profeſſion of ſome courſes that are good: they are fools, or knaves all, that go in ſuch wayes, meaning ſuch perſons as ſtrive to come neereſt the rule of the Goſpel. Perſons are ſtudied, not the way that they go in: the men are giddie, and of no account, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore away with what they profeſſe; this is the <hi>proprium</hi> of a weak brain. If Chriſt himſelf were preſent, this man would ſtumble at him, and loſe his ſoul, rather then he would take acquaintance of ſuch a ſilly outſide. Chriſt hath his glory within, ſo have Saints, and the way they walk in. <hi>[The entrance into it]</hi> as the <hi>Wiſe-man</hi> ſaith, <hi>gives underſtanding to the ſimple:</hi> Taſte how good Chriſt is in his wayes; begin the life of Chriſt and the Goſpel.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Ignorance is a great deal of diſadvange to a holy courſe, but wilfulneſſe a greater: This is the ſtrong hold of Satan, the Devill crowned, and all powers internall and externall united, and fighting to keep the crown upon his head. Many things torment,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:113418:153"/>
but one thing gains a Sinner, that is, the beauty and ſweetneſſe of the Lord Jeſus. High ſpirits ſhut their eyes, and ſhut their mouths; they will ſtand in no capacity of remedy, they will not come neer ſuch a perſon, nor ſuch a place, not they. Why? Chriſt is there. Let who will be there, I will not. This is rebellion in open act, and the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> explains the nature of it, <hi>'Tis a man ſetting his heart awry,</hi> and ſuch a ſoul ſurely can never move well; a Watch ſet wrong, cannot be ſtedfaſt in following the courſe of the Sun, and time of the day. <hi>And might not be as their fathers, a ſtubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that [ſet not their hearts aright] and whoſe ſpirit was not ſtedfaſt with God,</hi> Pſal. 78.8. A heart ſet awry, is a deſperate diſadvantage to an even courſe: where ſuch a temper is, men ſhould think of the patience of Chriſt, his love overcomes a ſtubborn ſoul. O that goodneſſe and mercy ſhould wait to embrace a froward heart, that will not continue, no not begin good!</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Ignorance is a great diſadvantage to a ſteady courſe, wilfulneſs a greater, but <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> the greateſt of all. <hi>A double minded man is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable in all his wayes,</hi> and yet he hath many, more then any ſinner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. An hypocrites ſoul, is like ſome wild Downs that have many croſs ways upon them, ſome this way, ſome that, but none to Chriſt, and therefore the ſoul loſes it ſelf, but cannot fix. An Hypocrite is one that obſerves the winds; not ſweet gales within, but gainfull gales without, from the world; his principles put him upon uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties; he is ever about to ſow, but never ſows, the wind ſtill turns ſo croſſe: when, or where he will have a harveſt, I know not. Things muſt be equally poiſed, to make ſteady and certain motion, and in this an Hypocrite is more diſadvantaged then any man, for he hath a great ſail, and a little bottome; a great head, and a little heart; great broad wings, and a little light body, like a Butterfly, and as ſteady in his flight. Have you not obſerved the flight of a Butterfly, how in and out he is? The reaſon may be, becauſe body and wings carry no proportion; 'thas wings big enough, and broad enough for a body of ſome bulk, which wanting, it cannot maſter and ſteer its courſe ſteady in the aire. Sinners have their proper puniſhment here; as all ſins have one common puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hereafter, to wit, hell, ſo they have their proper puniſhment here. I may ſay of all ſins but Hypocriſie, that they are ſimply a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:113418:153"/>
not coming to Chriſt, but I may ſay of an Hypocrite, that he is one come and gone, ſeemingly come, and really gone, and <hi>Cains</hi> curſe is gone after him, he ranges in forlorn places, and things, having ſeven more forlorn ſpirits in him then he had. Truth and integrity, is the ſoul of the ſoul; this is quite dead in an Hypocrite. A lie will chooſe a lie; the heart a lie, will chooſe any lying prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and ah what a many lies be there now in the world! I am affraid of mens integrity, lies are ſo generally taking and miſ-lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now: the ſpirit is as the things it ſtrongly cleaves to.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have ſpoken to perſons diſadvantaged, ſurely you will tumble up and down in your courſe, till you tumble to your place, if Chriſt ſhew not mercy to you. I will now ſpeak to you, which are advantaged perſons with gifts: Remember the point, ſuch are but uncertain creatures in their courſe: Truſt not in your advantages, for the certainty and continuation of your holy courſe. No mans light is ſo big, but Satan by his proper force, or by divine commiſſion, can blow it out; a ſoul in the dark, whither cannot the prince of darkneſſe lead? <hi>Sampſons</hi> eyes out, and a <hi>Philiſtine,</hi> a wicked perſon, may rule him. Parts looked upon, make the ſoul blind; and leaned upon, make the ſoul weak; for the man leaves a ſtaffe, and leans upon a reed, he will certainly fall, and yet he will not believe it, till he is down. Self is a gaudy thing; things that gliſter dazle ſight; ſight dazled, the man will move madly, you will ſee him run headlong into the ſea, and think it green graſſe and woods. When a man looks upon ſelf, the Devill alwayes lends him ſpectacles, and his glaſſe-eyes are alwayes a bad guide; things looked upon through his <hi>medium,</hi> are commonly of falſe dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, too big, or too little.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſad to heare, how confident ſome are of the ſtedfaſtneſſe of their motion: I will die rather then I will do this or that. Though all men forſake Chriſt, yet will not I. Thou knoweſt not thy ſelf, conſider how naught thou art now, although ſo and ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged for good; as temptations ſhall ſtrengthen upon thee, ſo wilt thou become worſe, thou wilt give backward and backward ſtill, till thou becommeſt ſtark naught. Some perſons upon view of ſelf, conclude they ſhall go currently on, for they finde they get victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over ſuch a ſin, and over ſuch a temptation, and the like. I would ſpeak to this, I am affraid you know not the nature of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption;

'tis like the ſea in its motion, it will ſeem to loſe ground, and decline ſuch a part of the earth much, for ſuch a ſpace of time, and of a ſudden again, by a little advantage of wind, come tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in, and ſpread over as much earth as ever, and more. Again, you know alſo this is its property, when it leaves one point of the earth, it will breake in as farre or farther, upon another point. It fals out oft, whilſt perſons are treading downe ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall acts of evill, the ſoule riſes and ſwels with conceit and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of its own worth and goodneſſe; here is a <hi>Babel,</hi> a Chriſtian blaſted before finiſhed, mouldring whilſt building; theſe buds wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe they want earth; their end is naught, ſo was their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, had they ſeene it. Such cannot hold out ſteady, whoſe ſpirits are lifted up with ſome poore gliſning ſnail creepings of their own. Poiſon that breaks out in the hands and face, and ſtruck in by ſome art, is not cured, but a thouſand times more dangerous. 'Tis the caſe of many; malignitie breaks out in their tongue, in their outward man, in ſuch and ſuch broad baſe courſes, which doe diſrepute them, and by ſome paines and art, they ſtop theſe filthy iſſues, and ſtrike the poiſon inward into their heart; ceaſe drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe &amp; debauchedneſſe, and now become proud; of rakels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come civilians and juſticiaries. <hi>God I thanke thee, I am not as ſuch and ſuch,</hi> no drunkard nor whore-maſter.

               <p>Things that would move very ſteady, muſt riſe very high; the upper region is quieter a great deale then the lower, and better for ſteady motion. As the ſoule riſes above the world, above its own indowments, above all without and within it ſelfe, and ſits fully and clearly in the armes of Chriſt, ſo is the ſtedfaſtneſſe of its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Chriſts armes doe not tire, his hands doe not ſhake, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries <hi>Venice</hi>-glaſſes full of choice liquor, and breaks not one, nor ſheds not a drop out of any one. How many ſoules hath God put into Chriſts hand! and yet he hath not loſt one ſoule; no nor one ſoule hath not loſt one drop committed to him to keepe. Satan is at our right hand continually, but he cannot come ſo neare Chriſt.

Wee cannot carry our hands ſteady a moment, he doth ſo jog it, and the more we ſtruggle to graſp and get into our hand, the more he jogs it; but the more we can emptie out all into Chriſts hand, the further ſtill from Satans power, and ſo conſequently ſafe. This age ſurely is ſo whimſicall, ſo drunke, ſo ſtaggering, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, becauſe it leanes ſo much upon its own braine, and ſo little upon Chriſt. <hi>They that waite upon the Lord, renew their ſtrength, they run, and are not weary;</hi> they run ſteadily to the laſt, till they have quite out-run ſin, Satan, and all moleſting. 'Tis ſure, ſweet moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when Chriſts armes ſtill are onely the Chariot-wheeles in all things. I wonder this advantage is no more ſtudied.

               <p>HOpe is a glad expectation of good; ſomething at a diſtance pleaſing, now and then ſmiling upon the ſoule, and the ſoule upon it. Man ſince his fall, hath but little in poſſeſſion, not enough to quiet his heart a moment. When I ſay, man hath but little, I doe not meane of the things of this life, (though all this world be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) he hath but little of God. Many have nothing of God; they that have moſt, have but drops, and a thirſt for flagons; in ſuite for much, enough to ſtay and quiet, <hi>Stay me with flagons,</hi> this is the panting of perfection here; and when the ſoule can conclude its ſuite takes above, and can ſweetly lie downe and looke for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, then it hopes.</p>
               <p>Joy comes not in by viſion here as it doth above, but by expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: fallen things as they lie, can glad no underſtanding man to
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:113418:155"/>
look upon. All the things in this world, will not make up matter ſufficient for a ſmile, if rightly underſtood: one may gather it from the compoſed countenance of Chriſt, all the time he was upon earth. This world is a big vaſt roome, full of broken ciſternes, and man the prime veſſell, moſt broken: ſuch a forlorne ſight, can it be matter of joy? And yet there are no other proſpects here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; take what houſe, what place, what advantage you will, to look abroad upon things here below, you cannot look beſides ruine and deſolation: that this ſhall be repaired, and all theſe broken ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternes mended and filled, and all made to run eternally into my ſoule, this may doe ſomething upon the ſoule, when it can riſe and reach ſo high, and this is hope. <hi>My [fleſh] ſhall reſt in hope.</hi> Hope is a ſoule at reſt concerning all things within and without, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit and <hi>fleſh,</hi> that they ſhall be all perfectly well.</p>
               <p>The ſoule of man naturally ſits up much now; diſtracted crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, can take little reſt; this is not well, that's not well, all will be worſe: the world will ſinke, and I ſhall be undermoſt: you may gueſſe by deſpaire, what hope is. Deſpaire is a ſoule wracking it ſelfe with what is,<note place="margin">Job 13.14.</note> and with what will be: <hi>'Tis one taking his fleſh in his teeth,</hi> torturing and tearing all, under his own apprehenſion of things. God is gone; he will never returne; if he doe, 'twill but be to ſend me to my place. Hope is the correction of theſe diſtempers. God is hid, he is not gone; I ſhall ſee him, though not now; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bone that is broken, <hi>ſhall rejoyce;</hi> every filthy iſſue in my ſoule, ſhall be dryed up. <hi>I will waite upon the Lord that hideth himſelfe from the houſe of Jacob, and I will look for him:</hi> this is hope, hope has the command of her ſelfe, but will not have the command of God. Shee has every thing that would rebell at her foote, but Chriſt in the higheſt eſteeme, of any of his daughters. Can he give bread? Will he give a crum to me? No, I ſhall eate this morſell and die, groane this groane, and my heart-ſtrings will breake: You never heard hope ſpeake ſuch a word; ſhee is a childe that ſpeakes juſt like her father. Our God is not come indeed yet, but he will come, and he will not tarry: though he puls down quickly, yet he takes time to build up, and this time haſtens. Deſpaire looks upon mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy at a ſtand, hope ſees it coming, and coming a great pace. <hi>My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved comes skipping upon the mountaines. (i)</hi> Certainly coming, and ſwiftly coming.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:113418:155"/>Hope hath but bad externall feeling, but all other ſenſes moſt acute. Shee can ſee a great way, heare a great way, and the like. In a dark day, when fogs are never ſo thick, ſhee can look through them, and behold the land that is far off: When ſhee is in the belly of hell, ſhee can look towards Gods Temple. When burthens preſſe, that ſenſe hath nothing but torture, nothing but devils to ſhake hands with, yet then ſhee can ſee a God, amongſt a thicket of Devils, though ſhee cannot come at him as ſhee would: though I cannot come to him, he will come to me where ever I am; though thouſands incompaſſe me, yet I will not feare, that is, I will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire of one to come to relieve me. Hope will carry more burthens then any grace, without ſinking. <hi>In perils by ſea, in perils by land, &amp;c. In povertie, in nakedneſſe,</hi> diſtreſſed in all kinds with a witneſſe, <hi>but not caſt downe.</hi> Hope is never caſt downe; ſhee will caſt downe any thing, men, devils, but is never caſt down her ſelfe; Hope is a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die long-lived grace, 'twill live in famine, when 'thath not a bit of bread; 'twill live in ſickneſſe, in warre, in death; <hi>The righteous hath hope in his death:</hi> Hope was never knowne to have her heart-ſtrings breake, 'tis <hi>ſemper vivens.</hi> Death is the King of feares, and yet it pales not the countenance of hope; hope walks in the valley of the ſhadow of death, and feares none ill, <hi>(i)</hi> expects no hurt: Hope can fee no ill, no hurt in any thing, not in death, not in the grave; that houſe is ſomething darke indeed, but I ſhall not alwayes lie there, ſaith hope. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in grave;</hi> though thou kill me, I will hope in thee; though thou burie me, I will hope in thee: I ſhall riſe as Chriſt did, this vile body ſhall be changed, and made like Chriſts glorious bodie, and then ſet for ever where his is. <hi>The fleſh doth reſt in hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hope is converſant about no ill, but about all good, and moſt about that which is nobleſt, 'tis <hi>appetitus excellentis boni, cum fiducia obtinendi:</hi> therefore is hope ſo often put for heaven, it doth ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten goe to heaven, and is ſo much taken up there. <hi>Looking for that bleſſed hope, and for the glorious appearing of that great God, and our Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Tit. 2.13. and ſo by the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> urged. <hi>To lay hold on the hope that is ſet before us.</hi> You ſee hope is put for heaven, and the reaſon is, becauſe ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant there. Hope feeds delicately, ſhee hath a table below, and this is nothing but the word of Chriſt. <hi>My ſoule hopeth in thy Word.</hi>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:113418:156"/>
Shee hath a table above, and this is nothing but Chriſt himſelfe, and the ſtate he weares above; this ſhee looks upon oft, and ſmiles to her ſelfe, when no ſoule alive is aware: <hi>Rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God.</hi> The two termes of hope, are hell and heaven; ſhee goes from the one to the other, and in this way turnes the one into the other, and this is all her worke; ſhee goes into every houſe of mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning where Chriſt is, and takes exact notice of every diſtreſſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall and ſpirituall, and then bids the mourner be chearfull, all teares ſhall be wiped from thine eyes; there is a houſe eternall in the Heavens, though this cracke and moulder, and there thou ſhalt ſigh no more. Hope is that good Angel, that carries <hi>Lazarus</hi> and lays him in <hi>Abrahams</hi> boſome; 'tis that grace which makes heavie afflictions light, long afflictions ſhort, by ſhewing the ſoule what they worke about, a far more exceeding, and an eternall weight of glory. Hope can ſpeake nothing but Heaven, and glory, to a diſtreſſed heart. I conclude as I began, Hope is a glad expectation of good, <hi>(i)</hi> of all good, but eſpecially the higheſt and the nobleſt good.</p>
               <p>Drooping hearts, thinke of this point, how uſefull is this grace for you? you have taken a houſe by the borders of hell, continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affrighted with evill ſpirits, that walke up and downe in your ſoules, and yet you love to dwell here. Terrors take hold ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, 'tis a heavie ſtroake, then the ſoule refuſeth comfort Senſe of fin is good, but its a wound of it ſelfe, that muſt be carefully dreſt oft with the leaves of the tree of life, 'twill rankle and kill elſe. Sinner, doſt thou know thy ſtate? Yes. Doſt thou know it exactly? Yes. Why, whither ſhalt thou goe when thou dieſt? To Hell. Haſt thou no hope of any other thing? No. Why wouldeſt thou ſtand ſtill all this while, and let thy ſoule bleed to death? Was there no Balme in <hi>Gilead?</hi> No word in all the booke of God that might ſpeake matter of hope to thee? Deſpaire in ſtrength, is very pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory in concluſions, but never deliberate in examinations of grounds. 'Tis a ſoule ſo toſſed and tumbled between Satan and conſcience, day and night, that it hath no power to ponder any thing.<note place="margin">Preſſus ab ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplo, diſcat ſperare ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da.</note> Thou ſhalt goe to hell, O my ſoule, when thou dieſt: Why? I have ſinned. So did all the Saints that are in Heaven when they were in earth; as now thou art; did not <hi>David</hi> ſin much in life, and yet what a brave hope had he in death? Sin enough in life, to make
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:113418:156"/>
him a type of Satan, for bloud and unmercifulneſſe; and yet hope enough in death, to make him a type of Chriſt. <hi>Thou wilt not leave my ſoule in grave.</hi> Yea, but ſome perſons ſins, have a very ſad conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration over others have. This is a truth, but no ſin or miſery muſt have any ſuch conſideration, as to ſinke the ſoule.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Hold this poſition, all that God doth is to bring us nearer to him. If he whip us, and ſtrike never ſo hard, or never ſo ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 'tis to bring us nearer him, not to drive us further from him. If he ſtrike the body or the ſoule, if he let looſe Satan to tempt, and let looſe the heart to fall, 'tis to bring the ſoule nearer to God: God doth nothing to drive away thy ſoule from him, nor would he have any thing elſe doe it: and wilt thou doe it thy ſelfe, by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing thou ſeeſt, heareſt, feeleſt, &amp;c? Deſpaire makes uſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall ſenſes all together, more then of the Bible, and conſtrues all things amiſſe: it harpes much upon the intention of God. God intends my death, he holds me for his enemie; fury guides him in all that he doth about me, one may run and read his frownes in all his actions. Thou frowneſt alwayes, O tempted ſoule, and thou thinkeſt God doth ſo. Thy ſoule is precious to Chriſt, he doth not deſire its death; 'tis more precious to Chriſt then to thy ſelfe; Chriſt would ſave it, and thou wouldeſt deſtroy it; he meanes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in the blackeſt ſaddeſt things that are upon thee, but love and mercy, therefore be not prejudized concerning his intention; the ſaddeſt things that are upon thee, if thou couldeſt but turne them upſide downe, thou ſhouldeſt ſee in them the ſmiling face of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Hold one poſition more, that Gods intentions toward us, are accompanied with the readieſt means to accompliſh them in us. Good is long a coming: this principle ſwallowed, is deſtructive to Hope; the next ſtep will be this, 'twill never come; Chriſt long a coming, the next croſſe makes the ſoule conclude, he will never come. Wee may not conſtrue Chriſt tedious in his motion; and yet 'tis hard to doe otherwiſe, when much put to it: when tryals are ſharpeſt, mercy and deliverance is neareſt. <hi>The Heathen rage. The Lord of hoſts is with us,</hi> ſaith the next verſe. <hi>Hold faſt, I come quickly.</hi> When 'tis as much as ever one can hold, tryall being ſo ſtrong, then Chriſt makes haſt, and ſalvation is neare. This princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple well laid into the ſoule, would make one hope to the end, hope
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:113418:157"/>
to the laſt man in a battell, to the laſt breath in a ſickneſſe. <hi>Jacob</hi> comes hindermoſt of the company. Chriſt comes after all means are done. <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which ſignifies laughter, is a childe of old age: Chriſt comes out of a withered womb; the man-childe that makes us laughter, comes out of means given up as barren. When Chriſt throwes a man downe, and throwes him very low, then is he about to raiſe him. When Chriſt kills, then is he readie to make alive. If this were received, who could deſpaire? Who would not hope of life, when every one gives him over? Yea of eternall life?</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Finally, hold one poſition more, that Satan and thine own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing heart, conſpire againſt thy tranquilitie; hope is the joy of a mans life, Satan hath none, and it addes to his ſorrow, when he ſeeth any elſe have joy, it greatens his hell, when he ſees any elſe have but a little of Heaven: Finall deſpaire ſhuts up that curſed ſpirit, and all thoſe that are with him: the worme that gnawes me, will never die; the fire that burnes me, is unquenchable; the chaines that hold me, are everlaſting chaines; the pit I am in, is bottome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, no poſſible paſſage from hence; not a drop of mercy falls in here, to cole any ſcorched creature, in the ſpace of eternitie; this is the tone of <hi>Tophet,</hi> theſe are the diſmall complaints, which thoſe reſtleſſe ſoules below throw out, as they role to and fro in that fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry furnace. Deſpairing ſinner, Satan is fallen in with thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, to conjure thy ſoule into this condition. Thou art in hell upon earth, as that other phraſe is, of her that is dead while ſhee lives. Tell me. How doſt thou ſleepe? How doſt thou eate? How doſt thou walke? How doſt thou talke? How doſt thou looke? Is not thy moiſture turned into the drought of ſummer? Thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy turned into skin and bones? Alas for thee, poore ſoule, God never made ſuch a way as this to Heaven, 'tis Satan and thy owne deſpairing heart, one evill ſpirit tormenting another, juſt as they doe below; and the deſigne is, to ſeale the ſoule up for wrath: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire is the black ſeale of the bottomleſſe pit.</p>
               <p>Lay all this together now, and doe but thinke how unkindly you deale with Chriſt for all his love and paines, which hath done ſo much for the tranquilitie of your life, to make you hope here, and poſſeſſe hereafter. Chriſt hath taken upon him your debts, there is not a ſin that ever you committed, not a treſpaſſe againſt any rule, but he will be accountable for it, and in your ſtead, and
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:113418:157"/>
all to make you hope. Some friends will undertake for part of ones debt, to make one chearfull, and this is much love, too much to be ſlighted; but then there remaines ſomething behind, and that ſads and ſinkes the heart. How ſhall I pay that? Bleeding ſoule, Chriſt leaves thee no debt to pay, no ſin to anſwer for. 'Tis lively ſet out in that Parable, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.32. <hi>O wicked ſervant, I forgave thee all that debt, becauſe thou deſireſt it; ſhouldeſt not thou alſo have compaſſion on thy fellow-ſervant?</hi> What ſhould make feare, when all is diſcharged? If I did know it were ſo. Doſt thou not deſire it ſhould be ſo? Wouldeſt thou not have all right and ſweet, between God and thy ſoule, rather then any thing? Yes. Why, this may be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration to thee, that all is right and even, between God and thee. <hi>Did I not forgive thee all thy debt, [becauſe thou deſireſt me?]</hi> God forgives debts to Chriſt upon exact ſatisfaction, but Chriſt forgives debts to us, upon complaining of them, and groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, and <hi>deſiring</hi> their diſcharge; upon a heart panting to be clean, the voice goes forth from Chriſt, <hi>I will be thou cleane.</hi> Pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing languiſhing ſoule for mercy, thou haſt obtained mercy; thou deſireſt to be cleane, why thou art clean; Shall Chriſt doe all this for ſo little, and wilt not thou hope, and chearfully expect the ſweet of that which he ſo freely gives.</p>
               <p>Finally, Doe but thinke, what a double miſerable life thou wilt have in theſe times, if this grace of hope lie ruinous in thee, through any wile of Satan. Thou wilt be as a Ship without an anchor, toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed terribly, and no poſſibilitie of ſtaying thee. <hi>Which hope we have us an anchor of the ſoule, both ſure and ſtedfaſt.</hi> If a man cannot ſtay upon God in diſtreſſe, he can ſtay no where; a ſoule that can ſtay no where, will hardly ſtay in his wits, when ſtormes grow very great. What is by ordination a center and reſt for ſuch and ſuch a bodie, a light body, or a heavie bodie, that and no other thing will give reſt to it. Chriſt is by divine ordination the center of ſoules; were there a thouſand rockes to caſt anchor upon, yet no rocke like this, the ſoule will not reſt upon any elſe. <hi>Their rocke is not as ours, themſelves being judges.</hi> All men finde this by experience, that what ever they pitch upon beſides God, to ſtay and relieve themſelves, it doth not doe it. O that the war were ended, that the war were ended. Fearfull ſoule, if this war were ended, thou haſt a war within thee, which will never end, till thy deſpaire end:
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:113418:158"/>
fighting without, and fighting within; others killing my bodie, and my ſelfe killing my ſoule: what a wofull life is this! Hope a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, this is the ſweet courſe of the ſoule, to wit, when all is black, deadly, and diſmall without, then the ſoule drawes the curtaine, and withdrawes from all theſe lower roomes, and walkes in upper chambers, where no noiſe is, views the Citie and Country above, and the inhabitants and priviledges thereof. <hi>Hope enters within the vaile,</hi> Heb. 6.19. Yet I know a Country where no war is, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance where no plundering is; neighbours and Citizens that doe not kill one another, but love one another dearely; that have not their ſwords in one anothers breaſts, but each other &amp; Chriſt; there I ſhall be quickly, and the ſooner, that theſe miſeries below are ſo heavy on mee.</p>

the ſoule is joynted, marrowed, how every ſinew and ſtring lyes, and what oyle is in the veſſels to ſupple them, and make them laſt, whether any or none. The heart is call'd the <hi>hidden man,</hi> and 'tis hid indeed, from all creatures in the world, from the man himſelf: that's a notable light that gets into a dungeon, a vault deep under ground, that is full of damps, and makes diſcovery there of all the mud and dirt, of all the frogs and toads that lie there, and yet ſuch is the light of the Goſpel; where ever it comes, though into never ſo dark a ſoule, it lays open all very exactly, that is, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. He that is unlearned cometh in, and he is <hi>convinced of all,</hi> and fals downe, ſaith the text; it tels a man all that ever he did, and very exactly. A true glaſſe, is of worth: All light flatters, but the Goſpel. That's an oyntment indeed, which takes off all ſcales, and makes perfect ſight in any one, and this is the propertie of the Goſpel; to whom ſoever it comes, though an ideot, as the originall is, he is <hi>convinced of all;</hi> 'tis ſpoken as the naturall property of this light, man cannot hide any thing from it.</p>

The glory of God is his face, all other light diſcovers but his back parts, or if it ſpeake any thing about the face of God, 'tis as <hi>vailed.</hi> To ſee the King is a great favour, but to ſee him in ſtate, that's a great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip indeed.

The glory of God is not to be expreſt: the Goſpel helpes us to <hi>Pauls</hi> viſion, to behold <hi>unutterable things.</hi> The face of God is his glory; the face of a man is his glory.

propriety, whether ſuch a one be a brother, a ſiſter, a father, I can tell you when I ſee his face, which is glorious to me when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. The Goſpel gives a diſtinct knowledge of God, by this, and by this alone; I am enabled to look as it were in his face, and to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne in what relation I ſtand to him, and he to me, whether I be his childe, and he my father, or otherwiſe. Mercy conſidered in ſuch a latitude, as eternally to ſave, is cald the glory of God; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcenſion to the creature offending, taking him up in his armes. 'Tis cald the glory of a man to paſſe by a fault, to abide ſweet when others are bitter, to ſmile and embrace, when there is no invite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but all diſcouragement; this is cald the glory of a man, and this is cald the glory of God. The Goſpel and no light elſe, holds forth tranſcendent condeſcenſion in God; by all other light, wee conceive of him as one that is auſtere, as one that will not yeeld a whit, as one that will have the utmoſt farthing, his own with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, or inflict death. The Goſpel holds forth all ſweet conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion in God, it ſets him forth, as one inviting, come, blinde, halt, as one <hi>waiting to be gracious,</hi> thirty, forty, fifty, threeſcore yeares, to the laſt houre, and yet giving a penny to him that came in laſt, as well as to him that came in firſt; it ſets him out as one that goes about to folkes-dores and <hi>knockes,</hi> ſinners doe you need any mercy? doe you need any thing for your ſoules or bodies, to make you bleſſed for ever? you may have it for nothing, <hi>Milke and honey, wine and oyle, tryed gold, and royall apparrell.</hi> The Goſpel ſets out God as one that expoſtulates with man, about the matter of his good, <hi>Why doe you lay out your money for that which is not bread? And why will you die?</hi> The Goſpel ſets out God, as one beſeeching man to be reconcild, as one that delights to exerciſe loving-kindneſſe, to make it his work, his daily buſineſſe, to forgive ſins, and to bring ſouls to heaven at his own coſt; this is tranſcendent condiſcenſion, and this is the glory of God in the eye of a poor ſinner; this makes him ſhine more glorious then any thing in the world; and all this, the light of the Goſpel diſcovers, diſcovers <hi>in us; hath ſhined [into our hearts] to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God.</hi>

more deadly to ſome perſons, then the powerfull words of the Lord Jeſus? What is more inraging at this day, then the ſhining light of the Goſpel? Our miſery is great, the cauſe apparent, we ſhut our eyes againſt the light. The Prince of darkneſſe ſhall rule; this is the vote of thouſands. Where Satan raigns, do you expect any other but a hel, rending and tearing, howling and yelling. Brave <hi>England</hi> is turn'd into a hel, oppreſſing, racking, rending weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wayling, and gnaſhing of teeth, and why? Certainly the Prince of darkneſſe raigns amongſt us; have you a glimpſe of that feind in all this our hel and miſery? If there were indeed a true love of the Goſpel amongſt us, could there be ſuch fighting abroad and at home amongſt us as there is? As light is precious, it conquers; as light conquers, pride falls; pride fallen, the Lion is a Lamb, Lambs rend not, nor tear one another. We rend and tear one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, name, ſtate, all that is dear, and would be to one another as the very devils are. Ah Lord! Is this a Chriſtian Land, a Land honouring the Goſpel? Doth it conquer us? Is the Spirit of the Goſpel in us, whoſe hearts burn like hel in pride and malice againſt one another? The hand of the Lord is upon an hypocriticall people, get it off who can. You ſay you love the Goſpel, and yet think the Land too good for them that faithfully profeſſe it: He that hates his brother in his heart, is a <hi>murtherer;</hi> a bloody ſpirit is in you, a bloody hand of juſtice is upon you, if this right not the innocent, and publiſh the hyporciſie of this generation to all the world, then ſay, that Chriſt hath not ſpoken by me.</p>
               <p>Would the ſword were ſheathed, ſaith many: would it had done its work, ſay I. We needed through launcing, mens baſeneſſe comes out freely: 'tis a mercy to know who loves the Goſpel, and how. How long will <hi>England</hi> bleed, ere good blood appear? Will that good bloud be ſo little, as not enough to hold life in the State? O that will be ſad! Sinners, look about you, you that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble with your light, are the plagues of the Land: doe you call whom you will, troublers, this will be found the truth which I have ſaid, you are the troublers, and the deſtroyers of the Land, and the ruine of all will be charged upon you.

               <p>I have but one thing more, let love be returned. Doth God give grand favours, returne anſwerable to him. The light which ſhines ſweetly and gloriouſly upon you, let it gaine your ſoules to God. Doth Chriſt ſpeake kindly unto you? Speake ſo to him. Doth Chriſt ſpeake for your hearts, to lay them in his boſome, and for no other uſe? How can you deny him? Give Chriſt your heart, 'tis no great favour, yet Chriſt accounts it ſo, becauſe 'tis your prime jewel: Chriſt doth take things according to your account, which is tranſcendent love: what you account your jewel, that Chriſt takes for one. If you make a ſin, a jewel dearer then any thing, yet if at the call of the Goſpel, you ſacrifice this, and offer it to Chriſt to doe what he will with it, kill it or keepe it alive, he accounts this for a great favour, a jewel; What you indeed and in good earneſt account great, that doth Chriſt, when in plainneſſe and in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie you give it to him. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was eſteemed by <hi>Abraham</hi> a great fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from God, and when he was willing to offer this againe to God, 'twas taken by God as <hi>Abraham</hi> accounted it, a great favour. The Sunne loſes none of its rayes, by all the courſe it runs, none darkened nor ſpoyled, but ſets as big, as glorious, and as ſmiling, as it did ariſe. Shall wee darken any beame of that light, which ſhines upon us? Shall we ſad the face of that Sunne that ſmiles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us? And yet ſo wee doe, when Chriſt cannot gaine us by his beames of love which ſhine upon us. Conſider how long time the Goſpel hath been amongſt you, and how little good it hath done. O that a heart ſhould be ſo cold, that twenty or thirty yeares lying in the Sunne, will not warme it. Hold a multiplying glaſſe, upon the Sunne that ſhines upon your ſoules, and ſee what this will doe: ſay to thy ſoul, How many precious Goſpel-Sermons have I heard! and how many thouſand thouſand ſecret words in them! how

have theſe ecchoed, with a ſweeter report from one within, then they were at firſt ſpeaking from the perſon without, which delivered them! how many ſweet Goſpel-words! yea, how many ſweet Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-workes, have I had! how many heart-liftings heaven-ward, and yet downe againe! Hath any body ſuch a cold heavie heart as I? 'Tis good to complaine of ones heart much for its badneſſe, to him that can make it better: 'tis good to complaine much of this badneſſe, badneſſe under goodneſſe, prime goodneſſe, badneſſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel. Cold-hearted ſinners, thus taber upon your breaſt, when you are alone; if any thing warme, 'tis well: if nothing will, draw the curtaine, and take leave of friends; if the Sun-ſhine of the Goſpel can by no meanes fetch heat in thee, thou canſt not live long, if thou wouldſt give all the wealth thou haſt, the fruit of the body for the ſin of the ſoule.</p>

If he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to do what he can for any diſtreſſed creature that comes unto him, and be the moſt miſerable in the world, he will diſpleaſe his Father, which we know he would not do, he would undergo hell firſt. The power that Chriſt hath for the good of ſinners, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily acted: The Sun ſhines upon all the world, and it cannot do otherwiſe. Chriſt in the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> when he had diſcourſed largely according to what latitude and compaſſe he wrought, for the ſalvation of ſouls, he puts it to this concluſion: I can do no leſſe, ſaith he, <hi>for this is the will of my Father, that [every one] that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, might have everlaſting life;</hi> if it be the tatterdſt, the forlornſt creature in the city, that looks pitifully upon me, I muſt look pitifully upon him, if he hang about me for ſoul favour, I muſt in no wayes caſt him off, but take him out of the jaws of death, and carry him in my arms to eternall life. What is the will of the Father, is the will of Chriſt; the will of Chriſt naturally, not artificially, in a way of ſelf-deniall, and conteſt, as the will of God is ſaid to be a Saints will; ſo that what the Father would have Chriſt own, Chriſt cannot but own, for the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is in him, and in the ſame meaſure; and therefore you have him ſetting himſelf forth by the Prophet, juſt as I do, as one <hi>bound</hi> by that Spirit which anointed him. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord, [is upon me] and he hath anointed me to preach unto theſe and theſe, and to comfort [all that mourn].</hi> a Chriſt doth not ſay, the will of the Lord is naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revealed to me, how far I ſhall ſhew mercy, and how far not; but the ſame Spirit that ſpeaks to me, ſaith he, <hi>is upon me</hi> (i.) in the ſame meaſure that it ſpeaks to me, 'tis in me, and ſo neceſſitates me to obey, or captivates me, as my own nature, and as my own affection. God is captivated with love, toward all captives; ſo am I, ſaith Chriſt; he would have all to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth; <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> ſo would I
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:113418:162"/>

                  </label> Sinners, if ever you would be ſaved, conſider this point well, how wide the arms of Chriſt are; how big the boſome of mercy is; it hath many thouſands between her breaſts already, and yet there is roome for you. The love of Chriſt is not coy, 'tis not hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, 'thath not naturall antipathy againſt any, but perſons that ſleight it. Sinners, ſinners, I beſeech you conſider it, at what height you love your ſins: Do you love your ſins above your bodies? above your eſtates, and names? yet there may be hope. Do ye love your ſins above your ſouls? this is ſad, yet there may be hope. But do ye not love your ſins above that love which ſtands with her arms open to you yet for all this? What hope can there be in this caſe? <hi>How can you eſcape the damnation of hell?</hi> as Chriſt ſpake to this generation. There is no art to make the ſoul ſet open the everlaſting dores, like telling him of the King of glory, which would come in. I conclude ſo, becauſe 'tis the art the holy Ghoſt uſeth. Mercy held out in the extent of it, is the King in viſible glory: drunkards, ſwearers, adulterers, ſet open your everlaſting dores, the King of glory would come into you, he would forgive your ſins againſt the light of Scripture, your ſins againſt the light of nature, your beaſtly ſins, I, thoſe wherein you have been worſe then beaſts, your ſins againſt your own bodies, as well as againſt your own ſouls; Love would get her ſelf a name upon you, by cleanſing and kiſſing of Swine, by laying a Toad in her boſome, by bringing a devill out of hel to heaven. Can you ſpit in the face of this Love, now in the ſight of all this congregation, and turn to your luſts again? Mercy comes to all your dores, ſhe falls down at all your feet, will you tread upon her? Mercy ſhews you what ſhe would have you do, Chriſt humbles himſelf to the duſt, laies himſelf at all your feet, if you would but do the like to him, not a ſoul of you ſhould periſh.</p>
               <p>We hold out to you now, the riches of grace, if it work kindly, you ſhall know it by this, the ſoul longs to be partaker of it: this grace muſt be nouriſhed; if longing die ere it obtain, the ſoul is guilty of ſtifling the Spirit. What buds in the ſoul will bloſſome, do but keep it in the Sun: <hi>all that are weary and heavie laden, have eaſe; all that are oppreſt with the devill, are healed:</hi> 'tis the thing
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:113418:163"/>
we are upon. If this grace work not kindly, the ſoul hardens it ſelf in its ſin. If love be ſo large, I may go on in my ſin yet a while longer, and do well enough at laſt; God rejects none, not young ſinners, not old ſinners; I will make as much as I can of my ſin, and lie as long as I may in the lap of <hi>Delilah;</hi> if I muſt part with it, I will part with it at laſt, when I muſt part with all. Death is ſeiſed violently upon this ſoul, he vomits his excrements. Would a <hi>Judas</hi> ſpeak worſe then this man? I will keep my covetouſneſſe and treachery as long as I can, if I muſt leave it, it ſhall be at laſt, when I leave this world, my maſter and my hope for ever. You cannot imagine the depth of guile that is in our hearts natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; no man will ſay ſo much as before ſaid in words, but thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſay it in deeds; ſay what we will, what we can, of juſtice, of mercy, of the latitude of theſe, yet ſinners will drive on in their own courſes, as long as liberty, ſtrength, and life will give leave. Theſe hearts are dead in treſpaſſes: Let what Sun will ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dead, it warms them not; theſe ſinners are twice dead; dead naturally, and dead voluntary; they have taſted of the ſweet of their wayes, and they get much wealth and pleaſure by it, and they are not children, to part with a reality for a fancie.</p>
               <p>Theſe are whole, and need not a Phyſician, our work is quickly done about theſe. Burthened ſouls, you are the proper ſubject of mercy, and of this diſcourſe, the call of this doctrine is to you: Come every one of you to Chriſt, and ye ſhall have eaſe, he excludes none: <hi>Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavie laden.</hi> A loded ſoul is ſelf-condemn'd, he cannot ſtand under the ſenſe of ſin and wrath; alas, who can? A ſoul ſelf-condemned, hath a halter about his neck of his own making; but do not hang thy ſelf: the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is very mercifull, he hangs none that comes to him as thou doſt, with a halter about his neck; hold a parly with him for thy life, thou mayſt bring him to what terms of mercy thou wilt, almoſt. Bid Chriſt make Propoſitions of peace, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> If he ſay that he wil have thee do this, and do that, deny thy ſelf, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him, pluck out thy right eye, and cut off thy right hand, and the like tel him, that through him thou canſt do all things; give me thy ſelf, and I will part with any thing; lend me thine hand, and I will riſe, draw me, and I will run after thee. Nothing is vile to me, but that which thou forbiddeſt, nothing dear, but that which thou
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:113418:163"/>
commandeſt; only let me touch the hem of thy garment, let me take hold of thy skirt, and I ſhall accompliſh thy will and mine own.</p>
               <p>This requeſt cannot be denied: Make this concluſion, and feed upon it, under all deſertion and temptation. Chriſt is ingaged, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, yea, about this very deſign, to give himſelf to thee. Chriſt is ingaged for thee by petition; thou haſt put up many petitions to him, and he hath put them up all to God, he could do no otherwiſe; for he is by place an Advocate, to mention and plead ſuch caſes, as are moved to him. Chriſt is furniſhed by conceſſion, for he is <hi>heard in all that he askes: my Father heareth me always.</hi> We ask many things and miſſe, becauſe we ask amiſſe: Chriſt alwayes asketh well, and ſpeeds well: therefore conclude of reliefe. You that mourne af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt, <hi>[he will] ſend a Comforter.</hi> The command of God is upon Chriſt, <hi>[he ſhall be] a light to the</hi> Gentiles. When Chriſt ingages himſelf by petition for any, God doth alwayes ingage him by conceſſion, and by accompliſhment for it. See thou do this poor ſoul good, my Son: here is for him, according to all that he needs, let it be laid out upon him according to all thou ſayeſt, will make him happy. Muſt he have my Spirit? my comforting Spirit? will no leſſe, nor no cheaper thing make him ſmile? will not a little Saffron mixed with ſome ſpirituous liquid, make him laugh? No, muſt he have my Spirit? <hi>my Joy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s</hi> then here 'tis. But be ſure, my Son, that thou give it him. The injunction of God is upon Chriſt, <hi>He ſhall be a light to the</hi> Gentiles. God doth truſt no Doctor, no Apothecary, none but Chriſt himſelf about drouping ſouls; and he puts into his hand, cordials of infinite price, and ſaith, that he ſhall give them, and his bleſſing with them; that he ſhall be, not only means of light, but <hi>Light</hi> it ſelf, to dark ſouls; that is, the bleſſing of means, as well as means.</p>
               <p>That Chriſt is about and upon giving himſelf to thee, O ſoul, I will demonſtrate to thee thus: Chriſt hath looked upon thee, this is the firſt thing a man doth, when he intends to beſtow him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon any; <hi>Abaſuerus</hi> viewed the damoſels firſt. The Son hath looked upon thee; that the Son hath looked upon thee, is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, for the beauty of his countenance hath taken thee, and thou wouldeſt fain have his Image to wear in thy breaſt, and if all thou hadſt would buy it, how willingly wouldſt thou part with it? the words which fall from Chriſts lips, are as marrow, and thoſe
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:113418:164"/>
which ſuit thy ſtate, as <hi>marrow and fatneſſe.</hi> Surely the King hath looked upon thee, and more, he hath a liking to thee. Thou loveſt him, thou mayſt conclude therefore, that he loved thee firſt. <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt,</hi> the man makes love firſt. Chriſt wooed thee long, ere he thus far gained thee, though thou take no notice of it. Nay, more then this, Chriſt hath beſtowed love-tokens upon thee, ſurely he is beſtowing himſelf to thee. Chriſt hath given thee by us his meſſengers as <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant, a golden eare-ring, bracelets for thine hands; by the word whch we preach, he hath given thee his Spirit, thou breatheſt as Chriſt doth, very ſweelty. I do not ſmell it. No, one cannot ſmell his own breath, when 'tis ſweet, only when it ſtincks much; but others ſmell it, in every room where thou comeſt.</p>
               <p>Would Chriſt were mine! Is not this the period ſtill, of thy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, at the end of every diſcourſe? Such an one hath got ſo much and ſo much, ſaith one to thee; doſt not thou reply? would Chriſt were mine, and then I had got more then he. Doſt thou not gaſpe only after Chriſt, when thou fetcheſt breath deepeſt? That's the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord Jeſus, which <hi>makes ſighs and groans, which cannot be expreſſed;</hi> he and thee ſigh together; one in another, and one after another. Love is mutually ſet, the contract is made, only 'tis not publiſhed to the world; ſome deliberate time is uſed about this.</p>
               <p>'Tis a diſtinct thing from being Chriſts, to know that I am his, and that he hath beſtowed himſelf upon me; and all the wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, quarrellings, and gain-ſayings of Satan, and a mans own ſoul, will not be quite dead, till the ſoul be quite in the boſome of Chriſt. When one argues from the beams of the Sun that there is a Sun, me thinks the cavillingſt ſpirit of unbelief that is ſhould lie ſtill. Had no body ever taken notice of any ray of the Sun appearing in the ſoul to argue from, only the word of grace preſſed, and the man that was al the dayes of his life a vile wretch, beholding his own neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and the riches of goodneſſe, and laying hold upon it, he were bound to believe that Chriſt accepted of him, and beſtowed himſelf upon him. I beſeech you weak ſouls, know two things, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be ſtrong: Know the riches of the Goſpel, and know the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligement of the Goſpel; it tenders mercy, 1. freely, and ſo it 2. muſt be owned; and ſo owned, though with never ſo much weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or with never ſo many temptations, yet that it ſhould
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:113418:164"/>
be effectuall to your ſalvation: the touch of Chriſts garment did the cure.</p>

The heart is in frame, when taken with goodneſſe, with all the goodneſſe of God. <hi>Thou haſt been very pleaſant to me</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Jonathan) Thy love to me is wonderfull:</hi> This he ſpake with an eye to <hi>all the love</hi> he had received from him, which is the right frame of the ſoule, in order to Chriſt and his: Thou haſt been very pleaſant to me, O Chriſt, throughout my courſe, and thy love to me hath been wonderfull, to my ſoule, to my body, in perſon, in office, in every condition. They are in a perfect frame above; the ſpirts of juſt men above, are all in a rapture, becauſe of all the love that ſhines upon them; there is not a beame over-looked; not a beame ſhines upon any ſoule in Heaven, but 'tis obſerved much, and warmes him much; our hearts are in frame as they ariſe, to this. Heat is the right temper of the ſoule; <hi>I wiſh thou wert hot.</hi> Heat is active, activitie is a ſoule gathering up all the goodneſſe of God, and feeding upon it, and then is the ſoule healthy and proſperous, and not otherwiſe. The conſtitution of grace, is ſomewhat as the conſtitution of nature, it feeds upon varietie, but varietie of God; God in riches, God in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, God in every thing: if God be miſſing in any perſon, in any diſh at the Table, it ſtinkes.</p>
               <p>Heat hath reſolution: divine reſolution tires not in dutie, though
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:113418:165"/>
never ſo great. Then is the ſoule well, when it faints not in the praiſes of God. Heaven is up-hill; and to skim off the creame of every creature, and to carry it up to Heaven, and to preſent it to God, is hard worke: to finde out God in every thing here below, and carry him home to Heaven, and ſet him upon his throne, and admire him, is great labour; and yet divine reſolution doth this, doth it in order to all divine diſpenſations, throughout the terme of mans life, and lays not downe the worke; no, lays not down the worke to all eternitie. <hi>I will mention the loving kindneſſe of the Lord, according to all that the Lord hath beſtowed upon us, and his great good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe towards the hoſt of Iſrael, according to the multitude of his loving kindneſſe,</hi> Eſa. 63.7. Nothing is ſo numerous as ſin, and mercie, but yet of the two, mercie is more numerous. The world hath not ſo many ſinnes in it, as mercies; and to act divinely in order to all theſe, to play upon a Lute, which hath I know not how many ſtrings; to ſtring a mans ſoule, with many thouſand thouſand mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that befall him, and to play upon this ſweely all ones dayes, and never lay aſide the inſtrument, this is a haile conſtitution; and yet all this but dutie, divine preſident is extant. Divine preſidents of this nature, are doubly binding: what any Saint of God ever did as a Saint, &amp; in order to the rules of ſanctitie, that comes to me with double authoritie to be obſerved; and therefore is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cited, and the cloud of witneſſes as another ſuperadded motive. Preſidents of ſanctitie, ſpeake not onely the precept to be obeyed, but the poſſibilitie, and honorabilitie of the precept, to be obeyed.</p>

How doe you travaile then up and downe after God? The Land wherein we live is full of mercies, no Land like it. Doe you tread upon them, or take them up? The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is beaſtly, yet very common. The Land is full of mercies, and full of nothing but brutes, that tread upon them. Brutiſhneſſe in a man, is ſenſualitie; a ſenſuall perſon, is one killed with kindneſſe; one that eats mercies, but doth not taſte them; weares mercies, but doth not feele them; ſeeth mercies, but doth not <hi>underſtand the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſſe of the Lord,</hi> nor never will: he is curſed to the duſt, as the ſeed of the Serpent, to goe upon his belly, upon his appetite; and upon no higher principle, through this world; to feed onely
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:113418:166"/>
upon duſt, and upon no nobler thing, for making a God of this world. You wonder at the plague, and at the ſword, but this is the greateſt judgement in the Land, that no man ſees the mercie that ſhines upon him. All the judgements that are in the Land, are but to caſt ſhadowes upon mercies, that you may ſee them well, and carry them and your ſoules to Heaven together. There ſhould not be a judgement more among us, did you ſee mercy as you ſhould: there ſhould not a man more die, did loving kindneſſe live in our hearts. The heart of this Land is eaten out with long tillage, God now dungs it, that things may grow well. 'Tis ſo with our ſoules: Our hearts are eaten out with vanities, nothing will come up that is divine, not ſpring up as high as Heaven. God pluckes up all, to pluck up your hearts to Heaven; 'twill be well if this be effected, although it be not till all be dead. When all is dead, if then a mans ſoule grow alive to God, bleſſed am I, though there be but this one thing alive of all I have. <hi>England</hi> is dead, God is burying it. Our hearts are quarred with fulneſſe, and become ſtones; no muſick can be playd upon a ſtone. God makes muſick to himſelfe with juſtice, ſeeing wee can make none to him with mercie: he ſets us to throw ſtones one at another, hard heart againſt hard heart, to daſh out one anothers braines, to kill a companie of men, <hi>Canini appetitus,</hi> of a dog appetite, whoſe belly is as the grave, and as hell, which cry, <hi>give, give,</hi> but never returne.</p>

How doe you beſtir your ſelves, Chriſtians, in gathering of honey for Chriſt? The garden in which you are, was never fragranter with flowers then now. Not a man you meet with, but you may wonder he is alive: not a ſtone in the ſtreete you tread upon, but you may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der 'tis not coloured with bloud: not a limbe you have, but you may wonder 'tis not cut off: not a good Miniſter, not a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, but you may wonder he is not cut in a thouſand pieces; how ponderouſly and warily ſhould we goe up and downe every where in <hi>England</hi> now, after all the great things that have been done in it, that wee doe not tread wonders in the dirt?

Our houſe is ſweeter then 'twas, husband ſweeter then he was, every thing is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed, a new gloſſe from an immediate hand put upon every thing; 'tis ſtrange that things that are ſo varniſht and inlaid from Heaven, ſhould not divinely take us. I am jealous of you Chriſtians, I am jealous of you, that yet Chriſt is a great loſer by you, in the glory of his Name. Divine heat is wanting in you, though God hath rubbed you ſo much and ſo long, till he hath rubbed off the skin. A man may diſcerne where ever he comes, that the goodneſſe of the Lord is not in your mouthes, is it in your mindes? You froth at mouth, and beſpatter every one that comes neare you with it, that one had need downe upon his knees to God, to waſh his ſoule from the filth that comes from you: theſe things are againſt you Chriſtians, but I ſpare you: Thinke but what God hath done, and what he is now adoing, and then thinke what hearts you have, that can be frothie now.</p>

The better the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment workes, the worſe lik't of the world, and the worſe uſed, this is ſorrowfull; but the more bleſſed of God to a gracious ſucceſſe, this is joyfull. The childe that comes laſt out of the wombe of dutie, is a pleaſant childe, <hi>[Now] I rejoyce in my ſufferings for you.</hi> The inſtrument that faithfully wrought, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; with theſe ſtripes many were healed: <hi>Paul</hi> lived to ſee this, this made him forget miſery, whilſt in it, for he was in bonds, when he ſpake theſe words. Dutie at laſt is ſweet, it comes off with Heaven, though Hell dog it for a time. <hi>Now I rejoyce.</hi>

                  <hi>Eſther</hi> ſighes, mournes, groanes, and then feaſteth and rejoyceth at laſt: 'tis a true emblem of Chriſtianitie, 'tis clothed with ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth a great time, but changes garments at laſt. Bleſſed are all that die in the Lord; Perſons when they end, actions when they end, though they end in bloud and death, yet if in the Lord, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of dutie, they are bleſſed with ſweet ſucceſſe, they eate the fruit of their travaile; 'twas ſo to Chriſt, 'tis ſo to us. Succeſſe is the crown of action, a crown from God here; Can a ſoule weare a crown from God here, or any where, and not joy, though a great while a putting on?</p>
               <p>This point muſt be underſtood. When I ſay dutie ends well, it muſt be underſtood, dutie faithfully diſcharged. Hypocrites are very doing, but action never comes off well; what ever joy they have in the beginning, they have none in the end; how much ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they ſit up and worke, yet they lie down in ſorrow; what fires and ſparkles ſoever they kindle, goe all out ere they goe out, and blaſt and not bleſſe the ſoule at laſt: this is a univerſall truth, made ſo by the hand of juſtice. <hi>Behold all yee that kindle a fire, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe your ſelves about with the ſparkes, this yee ſhall have of my hand, yee ſhall lie downe in ſorrow,</hi> Eſa. 50. <hi>ult.</hi> Chriſt crownes no hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite neither here nor hereafter, neither action nor perſon; all that is unſound, rots. They ſhall not eate of the travaile of their ſoule,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:113418:168"/>
how painfull ſoever their travaile be, but die in travaile, their hope is cut off: an hypocrites livery, yea his legacy, is nothing but a deaths-head; obedience faithfully diſcharged, ends well; where ever this ends, if it be in a priſon, or any where elſe, it is with joy.</p>
               <p>Obedience is rejected, becauſe of its iſſue, 'tis a damnable fault: they die in travaile that are married to Chriſt, therefore I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be married to him; he clothes his Spouſe with mourning gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and her coate is edged at end ſtill with deaths-heads; I will never be married to him! then thou canſt never come to Heaven, he brings none but his Spouſe thither. Though Chriſt doe not uſe his Spouſe ill himſelfe, yet he ſuffereth others to doe it; there is nothing but bloud and death in the way of God, I dare not ſet ſtep in it. Many ſpeake this in their heart, their not obeying, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of it. A ſad temptation is ſtrongly ſeized upon you, if it hold you, you are loſt; the fearfull of this ſort are ſhut out. There be troubles in every courſe under the Sunne; doſt thou find none in diſobedience? Then the more is to come. Bloud, and death, and hell, are at the end of thy way, Sinner; and yet dareſt thou to keepe on in it? Surely thou art not ſo much fearfull as wilfull. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction cures diſtemper, when 'tis but of meere weakneſſe; when the ſoule waits to turne in with Chriſt, and yet cannot; but where it is otherwiſe, lay open as much danger in one way pleaded for, as in another way pleaded againſt, yet the man will hold on his courſe, which ſpeakes the ſoule ingaged by will, and not ſo much overborne by weakneſſe, and then there is no entrance for right principles. I would let theſe alone which have ſhut themſelves up, till Chriſt breake open doores upon them, and ſpeake to a genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more ingenuous.</p>
               <p>Men that are candid, love to doe things that will end well: then ſet upon the workes of Chriſt. If thou be a Miniſter, preach Chriſt faithfully, who ever oppoſe; if thou be otherwiſe of any other ranke, practiſe the will of Chriſt ſincerely, what ever thou ſuffer. Things may goe harſh a time, but Chriſt will bring about a ſeaſon, <gap reason="foreign">

priſon, what a manſion have I to make me amends? Now I bleſſe God that ever I was hungry, that ever I was naked for Chriſt, what precious meate, and what glorious apparell have I, to make me amends? 'Twere enough, if the <hi>now</hi> of a Chriſtians joy, did not come till after this life: but ſhall a Chriſtian have one here? Let truth and conſcience keepe company in ſtormes, and I think I may aſſure any man, a ſweet calme here, let men and devils doe all what they can; but let theſe two be parted, there will never be a ſeaſon of joy, reall joy; the ſoule is betrayed, that hath any other opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or practice. The righteouſneſſe of action ſhould onely be eyed by us, as for other things, skin and bones, and goods, and ſuch like lumber, ſhould be all ventured in this bottome. I am for Chriſt, if I mourne all the dayes of my life, and have not one teare wiped off till I come to Heaven, all is one: ſo one ſhould ſet out, ſetting Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the furtheſt diſtance that can be thought of, and then a man meets with it often, long before he accounted; in this priſon, or in that dungeon, where one would look for hell rather then heaven; ſo did <hi>Paul.

Now I am in the mouth of the Lion, now I am in the belly of Hell, now I am in the face of Devils, now I own Chriſt, and triumph in all that I undergoe for his Name. Divine magnanimitie wee are to ſtand upon; 'tis a ſoule in all conditions openly very ſtout, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry amiable, in the purſuit of Gods will. Diſadvantages are many in a Chriſtian courſe, in none more: magnanimitie knowes none, 'tis one that can make a Trumpet ſound admirably, where there is no eccho; in a pit, in a dungeon; in his coffin, in his grave he will ſing, and make his chaines Late-ſtrings; among the dead he is alive, <hi>now I rejoyce.</hi> You have a Latine Proverb of warre, <hi>Mars communis,</hi> warre is of various event, ſometimes againſt one, ſometimes with
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:113418:169"/>
one: ſo I may ſay of the warre of a Chriſtian, 'tis <hi>Mars communis,</hi> ſometimes we come off well, ſometimes we are taken and chained, ſometimes the battaile is ſo hot, that all run away: Magnanimitie ſtands to it then, fights alone; ſhee is oft a priſoner, but never a run-away; one is enough, to wit, Chriſt, though all elſe run away; or how ever diſadvantaged otherwiſe, yet upon this advantage, ſhee ſtands to it alone, and fights with many; yea, fights and ſings, <hi>thunders</hi> and <hi>harpes:</hi> you have the voice of great thunders and of harpes joyned together, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.2. The ſervants of the Lord, fighting and thundring againſt Antichriſt, and yet harping and ſinging. <hi>Eſt virtus omnia ad gloriam ferens.</hi> A vertue that mouldes and ſhapes all things, good things, bad things, priſons, chaines, bloud, all to divine triumph.</p>
               <p>Magnanimitie is alwayes very ſtout, but alwayes very amiable: when ſhee breaths and collects ſpirits, ſhe doth not curve her brow, frowne and fret, and the like, but ſmiles in the face of crueltie it ſelfe. <hi>Michal</hi> ſcoffed <hi>David,</hi> and ſtoned him with her mouth, but <hi>David</hi> ſmiles and dances. <hi>Paul</hi> in chaines at <hi>Rome</hi> rejoyceth, <hi>now I joy.</hi> In the belly of Hell, <hi>Jonah</hi> prayes, yea gives thankes, <hi>I will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Lord with a voice of thankeſgiving; ſalvation is of the Lord. And the Lord ſpake unto the fiſh, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land,</hi> Jonah 2.9, 10. As the verſes goe, and are conjoyned, one would thinke they did carry this brave ſenſe, that as ſoone as God did behold <hi>Jonah</hi> in this brave poſture of ſpirit, not onely big with prayer, but with praiſes, even in the belly of the Whale, that then he ſpake to the Whale to give him up, that then he ſpake to Hell to give up that perſon to Heaven, whoſe ſpirit and action was there before. There is an amiableneſſe of perſon, and an amiableneſſe of action, and Magnanimitie hath both; ſhee ſets the countenance right, the eye right, and the hand right: when ſhee is ſtout, 'tis in the truth, and for the truth; ſhee purſues a noble game, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres all evill means to catch it; to get Earth, to get Heaven, ſhee will not be bribed; when there is any baſe carriage in a buſineſſe, none more ignorant of any ſuch thing, then a Chriſtian truly mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous. Chriſtian magnanimitie is borne of humilitie and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie, and hunts after nothing more, then the incouraging of the parents of which ſhee came, but this ſhee purſues to the utmoſt.

Chriſtian, <hi>Nervis cunctis incumbere,</hi> intend with every ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new: all things that are ſimply ſinfull, or but of meane account, come not into his thought.

                  </label> Wee are put by providence to ſpeake upon a ſeaſonable ſubject; times call us to move bravely every one in our place. Furie is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and furie is at home, nothing but a brave ſpirit can now kiſſe Chriſt, and ſmile in the face of both. Greatneſſe will over-bear, and joſtle a weak ſpirit, though otherwiſe good as a childe from his father, and make him cry, and take on dolefully, for want of that countenance which did ſmile upon him. Power gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates pride, unleſſe it ſit in a very ſweet breaſt; the effects of this are bloudie, and not a man can withſtand to any purpoſe, but he that is ſteele to the backe. 'Tis ſaid of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah,</hi> that when he was ſtrong, that is, externally ſtrong, <hi>that he was lifted up to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</hi> This Prince after his great victories, fell upon the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and carried it by his owne greatneſſe as he pleaſed, (which is a plague proper to pride, to be ſpiritually and deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wanton; to creepe into the Temple, and to confront God as highly as may be.) And the Text tells us of <hi>Azariah,</hi> and fourſcore brave Prieſts of the Lord that withſtood him, ſaying, <hi>It pertaines not to thee, O King, to burne incenſe, but to the Prieſts of the Lord, which are conſecrated; goe out of the Sanctuarie, thou haſt treſpaſſed, and it ſhall not be for thine honour.</hi> There were fourſcore of theſe
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:113418:170"/>
magnanimous ſpirits then, would there were fourſcore thouſand of theſe now in the Chriſtian world, they are much needed, to withſtand violence againſt the worſhip of God, againſt the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Miniſters and people. Blindneſſe hardens men: fooles will as ſoone ſtrike with a club, as with a twig, as ſoone ſtab with a knife, as with a ſtraw, every one that bowes not downe to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol of their fancie: this is ſtoutneſſe to deſtruction, as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited Scripture ſpeakes, and 'tis pitie it ſhould deſtroy any but ſuch as are guiltie of it: and yet it will, if not withſtood. What a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full condition would all have come to, if thoſe few brave ſpirits, had given way to all that the King in the blindneſſe of his heart would have done! A Chriſtian indeed magnanimous, is he that ſtands in the gap in a time of wrath, and none elſe: this man is a <hi>Phinebat,</hi> an <hi>Azariah,</hi> one that ſtayes the plague, the ſword, the wrath of God, that eates upon us, and would eate us out all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſome ſuch brave ſpirits appeared abroad, and at home, in the field, and in the Citie. You can doe no ſervice to quench the fire of jealouſie, that now burnes, unleſſe you get more fire in your hearts. Life and death is in the ballance, and the ſcales ſtand, which ſcale will weigh downe we cannot tell; onely this I can ſay, this grace of Magnanimitie put in that ſcale where the life of the Kingdome lies, would turne the beame preſently, and life ſhould weigh downe death; peace and proſperitie, ruine and deſolation. 'Tis pitie that brave ſpirits are no more ſmil'd upon; ſome ſuch buddings of hope are now and then, but they are blaſted againe; men are alive a while, and then dead. Perſons which are in ſuch a condition, that are pretie well one while, and at deaths-dore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine another while, men have ſtill feare leſt ſome vitals waſt in ſuch a ſtate, which is not yet diſcerned. <hi>England,</hi> if death ſhould cure all thy diſeaſes at laſt, for want of a little life, what a dolefull giving up the ghoſt will this be! Whither wouldeſt thou carry thy cold off-ſpring, that they might grow more warme? To ſuch and ſuch plantations beyond the Seas? Between thee and them is a great gulph, and it may be, they that would goe to them ſhall not, &amp; they that thou wouldeſt ſhould come to thee will not: they that ſtay in the Citie, famine may devoure; they that goe to flie out, a ſword may cut off; A Serpent, a Lion, or a Beare, ſword, famine, or plague, may divide all between them, within dore and without.
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:113418:171"/>
Surely, <hi>England,</hi> thy giving up (if ever that ſad day come, which the Lord grant it may not) will be with ſuch ghaſtly groanes, with ſuch hideous ſhreechings, with ſuch tabering of breaſts, and tearing of haire, with ſuch weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth, as ſcarce ever any eye ſaw, or eare heard, ſince wrath and deſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on began among the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>Wherefore call upon thy ſelfe, O <hi>England,</hi> and call upon thy Phyſicians for Chriſtian magnanimitie: tell them what death thou feareſt, and what grudgings of it thou feeleſt alreadie in ſeverall parts. Where there be palſies, and ſuch diſeaſes, which are by cold, which be numbe and dead the parts, there rubbing is good to fetch heat and agilitie. Rub one another frequently, exhort one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther daily, ſtrike fire in one anothers breaſts, admoniſh, reprove, but doe all in love. Paſſion generates paſſion; wild-fire is not mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimitie, this burnes all, it doth not ſave all. Magnanimitie ſprings out of love; 'tis a ſtout ſpirit candid with the ſweetneſſe of Chriſt, and made a Lamb and a Lion, as Chriſt was; a Lamb, when among ſheep, to be led by them; but a Lion, when among Beares and Wolves, to awe and lead them. Magnanimitie is the perfecteſt temper of Chriſt, in all this world; 'tis a Lion lying downe with a Lamb, and doing it no hurt; and a Lamb playing upon the hole of an Aſpe, and receiving no hurt: it is one that can doe no hurt, but can and will doe much good; 'tis one that fels himſelfe like Chriſt, at a very low rate, to doe good to all.</p>

There is ſuch an affinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the body and the ſoule, that it is hard to ſeparate them in ſuffering, yet a divine hand of God, who is father of ſpirit and fleſh, makes burthens pinch more upon the one then upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as pleaſeth him <hi>Pauls</hi> cup was eminently proportion'd to Chriſts, 'twas <hi>to fill up that which was behind</hi> of the afflictions of
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:113418:171"/>
Chriſt; and Chriſts cup had thoſe ingredients, which made his ſoule heavie to death, they did deeply affect, not onely his fleſh, but his ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Body and ſoule were as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> brethren in evill, and God makes chaines to couple both together in miſery, and pinches that part moſt that is worſt, puts double bolts upon the leader to ſin, that's the ſoule. What God joynes, he would not have us to part, what we joyne, he will not part; we joyne body and ſoule in ſin, and he doth not part them in ſuffering, not in the beſt. Chriſt can diſtinguiſh between theſe two in the matter of affliction, and ſo lightly touches the fleſh, that it ſhall never trouble the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but then man uſually deſpiſeth the chaſtening of the Lord; yea, the beſt are apt to doe ſo. <hi>[My ſonne] deſpiſe not the chaſtening of the Lord.</hi> God puts ſuch twigs in all his cords for his children, that he makes no wantons of them: when they joy in ſufferings under one notion, they ſhall ſorrow in them under another: When they joy in ſufferings, it ſhall be againſt ſenſe, and againſt reaſon, not as if they did feele a little, but as feeling much, onely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the iſſue, how glorious and how precious that will be. Bonds and chaines are ſo heavie, as to make our joy a pure joy; the miſery of Saints is ſo ponderous, as to preſſe their joy pure, to make it a joy of faith, not of ſenſe in the leaſt, body and ſoule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both in paine.</p>
               <p>You ſqueeſe out the ſpirit and puritie of things, ſo doth Chriſt. Chriſt doth ſo affect the body and ſoule in his dealings, that if any grace act forth, it ſhall be pure grace, ſuch as is fed with no low principle. If joy worke, it ſhall be from faith, not from feeling: if faith worke, it ſhall be from the word without, not from any thing that it feeles elſe or ſees, without or within. Our heights are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated, with one <hi>medium</hi> or other. When our ſoules are higheſt, they are wound and ſcrewed up to it with much paine, and then when raiſed to this height, 'twould not be downe againe for all the world, but kiſſes the rod, chaines, priſons, any bitters that worke about ſo ſweet, ſo heavenly a life, as to joy purely in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The nature of divine trials, is the thing that I would ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how the arrowes of the Almightie are ſhaped, now ſharpe theſe are, which he ſhoots at his people, they pierce thorow all, body and ſoule. <hi>Wherefore is life given to him that is in miſery, and light to him
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:113418:172"/>
that is in bitterneſſe of ſoule,</hi> Job 3.20. Theſe expreſſions aptly ſuite the point I am upon, and doe open the nature of thoſe trials, that befall the godly: they have miſery, that is not all, they have miſery wrapt up into ſuch bitter pils, as work upon the ſoule. That's ſtrong phyſick indeed, that ſets all a trembling &amp; caſting, body and ſoule, yet ſuch God gives thoſe he loves dearly: <hi>in bitterneſſe of ſoule;</hi> the expreſſion is very emphaticall, like that to <hi>Elymas, in the gall of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe;</hi> it ſpeakes a ſtate ſteeped, and ſoaked long in miſery, till ſoaked quite thorow; every ſinew ſtretched, every bone put out of joynt, no whole part within nor without; not a thought lying ſtill, nor knowing where to find a pillow in any roome of the ſoule, to lie downe on.</p>
               <p>God makes no diſtinction of perſons here, I meane in the point that I am purſuing. <hi>All things come alike to all,</hi> alike ſweet, alike bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, alike for qualitie, alike for quantitie; a veſſell of honour filled as full of ſorrow here, as a veſſell of wrath, <hi>waters coming into the ſoule.

None but evill ſpirits are broken and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd below, they are all curſed creatures that roare there: but here good as well as bad, are broken all to pieces; all roare here, wicked men, Saints, brave Spirits, <hi>I am ſore broken, I roare.</hi> What a dreadfull din and noiſe is all this world over! One would thinke one were in hell whileſt here: in every Countie, in every Citie, in every houſe; no dore ſprinkled for a paſſeover in this point of ſorrow, ſorrow at the heart. <hi>The arrowes of the Lord are [within me.]</hi> No houſe ſo wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, nor ſo high here, but God ſhoots into it when he will: he moves in order to all trials with the godly, as he doth in order to all judgements with the wicked, according to an abſolute will. When he will, he takes up whom he will amongſt the wicked, and truſſeth him up ſo or ſo, quarters him, and hangs up his quarters, makes him leſſe or more notorious, as he pleaſes: ſo when he will, he takes up whom he will of the godly; priſons, chaines them, till the Iron en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into their ſoule, ſets them up as a mark, and ſhoots them cleane thorow. <hi>Why haſt thou ſet [me] up as a mark to ſhoot at?</hi> Job 7.20. And this a meere exerciſe of prerogative will, which <hi>Job</hi> could not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand at preſent, but did afterward. Though God hath made o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much to man, yet hath reſerved this priviledge to himſelfe, to have his Range in this great Foreſt here below, &amp; to ſhoot at what
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:113418:172"/>
he will, at what goat he will, or at what Deer he will, and at what part of this Deer he will, at the heart, ſo he doth not make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable wound.</p>
               <p>And this Chriſt can doe, and this may be the reaſon of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge. He wounds as he pleaſes, becauſe he can heale as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſhoots the body, and ſhoots the ſoule of his people, becauſe he can take out the bullet where ever it lies, and heale that part as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, yea perfecter then ever 'twas. Poiſons that gangrene and eate upward and inward towards the heart, Chriſt can ſtop their ſecret motion, and draw out the poiſon at the pores of the ſoule, at the eyes, at the mouth, in ſpirituall breathings, and kind ſoule-ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, pantings, mournings, and turne this poiſon that drops out of theſe pores, into a precious ſpirited liquid, and bottle it up as a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall for himſelfe to drinke of, and to delight his palate withall for ever. The rareſt ſpirits, are extracted out of the ſtrongeſt poiſons, and Chriſt wants no skill to doe it; he is an admirable Chymiſt, and therefore takes whom and what he will, to try his skill upon. There are no ſuch poiſonous things in the world, as ſin and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially when they meet together in the ſoule, and yet then Chriſt can extract ſuch a ſpirit out of both, as all this world ſhall hardly match. Chriſt can bring a body downe to the grave, and raiſe him up againe, and make his bones like <hi>Behemoth,</hi> like <hi>barres of Iron. David</hi> found it oft: <hi>Thou haſt renewed my ſtrength like an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle.</hi> So Chriſt can bring a ſoule down to Hell, and raiſe it up againe to Heaven, yea bring him up ſo full of Heaven, that not one of a thouſand, not one of fortie thouſand comparable; and what Chriſt can doe in this point, he doth when and as he pleaſeth.<note place="margin">Mibbor ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

lips upon, for the next to drinke: 'tis no other then what he gives to the beſt of his. Miſapprehenſion makes burthens intolerable, which is heavier then ever Chriſt intended to any Saint. When any twig in the rod ſtings the ſoule, when any thing ſtickes and preſſes hard upon the ſpirit, the concluſion is, wrath made this rod, and 'twill kill me if I had a thouſand lives. Theſe are our concluſions, meerly ours and Satans, Chriſt hath no hand at all in them. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly diſpleaſure, is love, a God ſetting himſelfe againſt your ſin, not againſt your perſons, he hath imbraced theſe with an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love. Satan viſits much when the ſoule is in paine, 'twere well if good hearts did know when he comes; his counſels, his preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are all deſperate; when the heart is heavie, then he ſhewes ſuch the nailes of that hand that is upon them, how long they be, and how hard they pinch, and what deepe dints and blacke and blew markes they make, <hi>(i)</hi> he makes an exact collection of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances about every ſtroake of God, with his own comment in the margent. As to inſtance; Love doth ſtrike her beloved ones indeed, but doth ſhee ſtrike ſo ſtrong, ſo long, ſo deep? Doth ſhee ſtrike and not ſtroake a jot? Not with her own hand, nor no body elſe? Doth ſhee wither every other womb of love, when ſhee leaves bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth her ſelfe? 'Tis a frowne of God, 'tis a pang of death upon the ſoule, certainly thou canſt not recover it, ſaith that curſed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. One would conſtrue the Devill under a notion of ſimplicitie in this, (there may be charitie to the Devill) he is ſo under juſtice himſelfe, that he can ſee nothing elſe, and this is the ſtrength of the torment that is upon him: but yet then he is to be judged no fit leader in ſuch a caſe as this, when he hath to doe with ſpirits in a better ſtation then himſelfe.</p>
               <p>The workes of God are wonderfull, eſpecially ſuch as reach the ſoule, and need to be read over often, ere a man venture to make a poſitive concluſion upon them, that this and no other is the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Afflicted Chriſtians, you are too raſh, too venturous, paine puts you into paſſion, that's a very miſ-judging condition. You judge things before the time; this in ſmall matters is no ſmall fault, nor of no ſmall evill event, but what is it when a man doth thus about the greateſt acts that relate to him in all the world? The tranquillity of the ſoul is embarked, in a right judgement of things; let Satan, your own paſſion, any wile whatſoever, overturne this,
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:113418:173"/>

Pray Sir, deale faithfully with me: Do you ſee any plague ſpots in my breaſt? There be ſpots there, are they the ſpots of Gods people or not? How black be they? How broad be they? How many be they?

               <p>Judgement ſetled, and ſomething may be ſpoken to the man, to doe him good. There are two conſiderations, which may much relieve, when trials pinch the ſoule; 'tis for ſome through and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble good to the partie, and for ſome through and noble uſe for Chriſt. The throne of iniquitie is ſtruck at, the head of the Serpent is trod upon: powers within, are Satans ſtrongholds, things which paine and ſhake theſe, come to Satans bed-ſide, and holds a knife to his throat, where he lies, tumbles, and ſleepes. The Granadoes which are caſt into the ſoule, burne the devill in his bed, they burne the branch, yea they burne the root of ſin, 'tis an axe to the roote. Sin conſidered as it lies lodged in the heart, is the root of it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Covetouſneſſe is the root of evill,</hi> it being as it were the heart to all other ſinnes. Exorbitant affections, which lie all within, theſe are the roots of all the ſin you act; that which is ſo ordered and ſteeped, as to affect theſe diſ-affected paſſions, ſtrikes at the root of ſin. Seeſt thou a man prickt in ſoule? Stand ſtill; thou wilt ſee pride come downe branch and root. Seven Devils tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out; a floare throughly cleanſed, <hi>droſſe purely purged away, a man made cleane every whit,</hi> outſide, inſide, all faire, in the eye, yea in the vote of Chriſt, yea in the vote of Chriſt to the ſoule it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:113418:174"/>And now and not till now, is a Chriſtian fit for noble ſervice, thus throughly dead, and thus throughly raiſed. Pride ſlaine, all her children, that is, looſe affections murthered in their bed, the meek and pure ſpirit, crowned with a viſion of God, you may ſend this dove forth any where, he will come home with an olive branch in his mouth. Set this ſoule about what worke you will, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to a Chriſtian, and he will doe it truly; and if it be to cloth the naked, to relieve the oppreſſed; heel powre out his ſoule or ſtate to the needie, and he will doe it with tender bowels, becauſe he hath needed them himſelfe, and hath taſted how ſweet they are. When the ſoule goes forth in action, then is action done nobly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. <hi>The Lord is with them that uphold my ſoule,</hi> ſays <hi>David;</hi> and we thinke he points at <hi>Jonathan,</hi> when he had ſcarce any elſe to cleave to him. When every ones heart was as Iron, <hi>Jonathan</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>David</hi> as his own ſoule; <hi>Jonathan</hi> had been put to it, he knew what 'twas to be in ſtrait for his life, ſo unfatherly was his father, and therefore he proves a brave ſpirit for this noble ſervice, to ſave the life of <hi>David,</hi> to raiſe him, and Chriſt in him, to his throne: he was all heart and ſoule in it, and God was with him. God is doubly preſent with a man, which he hath much exerciſed, which is an incomparable advantage, to all divine uſefulneſſe. No man can ſpeake ſo feelingly, ſo healingly, as he that hath much of God ſpeaking in and with him: this is the man of a thouſand, that can ſpeake words in ſeaſon, <hi>like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver,</hi> that can lend legges to the lame, eyes to the blind; that can comfort thoſe which are caſt downe, with the ſame comforts wherewith he hath been comforted from the Lord.</p>

The meaſure of ſuffering, that tendeth to ſatisfie for offence, and ranſome man from the wrath of God, Chriſt hath fild up to the brim; the cup was big, but Chriſt poured out blood enough to fill it: one would have hoped that all ſuffering worke belonging to a Chriſtian, had been done then. No, 'tis not, ſaith the Apoſtle, I doe <hi>iterum implere, rurſus implere, fill up againe,</hi> the ſufferings of Chriſt. Malice lives ſtill, Chriſt is crucified afreſh in his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: Chriſt doth bleed in my veines afreſh, ſaith the Apoſtle; if there were any drop of blood left behind, when he bled upon the croſſe, now tis fetcht out through my ſides.</p>
               <p>How implacable is the fury of man! the fury of God was ſtopped when Chriſt had bled to death, and 'twas not his will that ever Chriſt ſhould die any more, or that any one ſhould die more for Chriſts ſake; but yet the fury of man lives, and that would have Chriſt die over and over, <hi>iterum iterumque,</hi> againe

and againe; 'twould have every houſe pulled downe and burned, that Chriſt gets into: 'twould crucifie his image, his picture; 'twould make him bleed as long as this world laſts, yea, to all eternity, therefore doe wicked ſpirits in hell blaſpheme and teare his name, a worke which they will never leave, though it continually adde to their plague; and yet theſe doe but ſhew the nature of all malicious men on earth, which are everlaſting blood-hounds, which ſpend perpetually upon the ſent of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, upon the ſent of Chriſt, in any earth.</p>
               <p>Malice ſhould be looked upon as tis an implacable thing; and men in whoſe breaſt it is, ſhould be looked upon as they are, fire-ſhovels fetched from hell, to carry everlaſting fire from houſe to houſe, from place to place, where ever Chriſt is, to burne him out of this world quite; to burne him againe and againe, till there be none of him left, not a finger, not a toe, not a haire. We are much given to wondring, we know the reaſon of things ſo little: to ſee a man drinke blood, and never be weary of drinking ſuch a fulſome drinke, tis ſtrange to us: yet tis the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of that fire that burnes in the breaſt of the man, to make an unquenchable thirſt after this red Wine; tis a damnable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe that the man cannot helpe, nor no man upon earth for him; every good body muſt keepe out of his way as well as they can, I know no other remedy; the man will ſet abroach any ones blood, <hi>Pauls, Chriſts,</hi> any one that lookes like either. Chriſtians have a bleſſed keeper, or elſe how rare would they be in the world? Bleſſe God that there is a good man left in the land at this day, in the middeſt of ſo many blood-thirſty.

Tender goodneſſe orders the great hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of Saints; when their cup is mingled by hard hearts, Chriſt hath one tender heart or other ſtanding under the devils elbow, which he ſees not, to drop in ſome ſweet to make the bitter goe downe; one <hi>Ebedmelech</hi> ſtands under the tyrants elbow, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the miſerie of <hi>Jeremy.</hi> The over-ruling hand of God is in this, of which there can be no reaſon given but his tender goodneſſe; for every righteous man is abominable to the wicked, and when they fall upon one, they would fall upon all, and there is enough of them to diſpatch all, but that the Lord of his mercy hinders.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Juſtice is in this point, that hard hearts may be without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. Every degree of unkindneſſe notes not a man without bowels; neither doth Chriſt write downe men as mercileſſe after this rate. A neighbour in good condition asketh ſuch a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuch a man, which might be done and no prejudice to himſelfe, and yet tis denied. I cannot write downe this man as
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:113418:177"/>
mercileſſe yet, ſaith Chriſt. Another day a poore man comes to deſire ſuch a favour of this man, as tends much to his maine ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and tis denied: yet I cannot write this man mercileſſe, ſaith Chriſt. But lay a <hi>Lazarus</hi> at his doore, a creature that hath his skinne full of holes, and an hundred hundred monthes cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all at once for mercy, in one man; lay a Souldier at his doore, which hath ſo many wounds in his head, ſo many in his backe, all gaping, crying and mourning, with teares of blood, for compaſſion; bring a priſoner to his doore, let him cry and gingle his chaines: Sir, I lie upon ſtones, and I muſt live upon ſtones too, if you give me no bread; my food is ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my drinke my teares, my bed iron chaines, ſhew mercy Sir, ſhew mercy, or I periſh; let this man be in a Kingdome where there are many of theſe <hi>Golgothaes,</hi> and <hi>Aceldamaes,</hi> a field of blood, of skuls and broken bones, among many gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and tumbling to and againe, with their bowels out, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding up their hands, Sir be mercifull, I beſeech you be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and doe what you can to relieve me: No, I will not. Now ſays Chriſt, write downe the man for mercileſſe. What ſhall I ſay of this generation? they are mourned to, and yet lament not, I have ſpoken to them, ſaies Chriſt, I have mourned to them, but words, teares, ſtirre not: when the moſt ſpeaking things to move compaſſion move not, then are a people writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe for mercileſſe.

Men that love their ſinnes, love not to heare that ever they ſhall be whipt for them. Evill is acted with confidence, that it ſhall never be judged, <hi>hee that ſits in Heaven doth not regard ſince the beginning all things are as they were;</hi> I have bin a ſinner this twenty yeares, and yet all is well: This is groſſe folly, Chriſt laughes at it, but we ſhould mourne, that men have no more grace, hee ſees that your day is comming, yea, hee ſees that you cannot avoid it, whileſt in this ſtate, and therefore makes no more haſte to take hold of you. A creature that is faſt in any Engine we lay, we make not haſt to come and breake the neck on't, and kill it outright, becauſe we know 'tis faſt, and therefore wee come ſlowly. Security is Satans deadly Engine, you are faſt in the bonds of iniquity, juſtice is ſure of you, therefore it doth not make haſte to come and break your neck, and to diſpatch you utterly. When your day comes it will be a bloudy day indeed, a day as long as a yeere, as long as eternity; a day that will never have night. When your priſoning and chaining time comes, your chaines will be <hi>everlaſting,</hi> your bout will be long, mercy makes Juſtice therefore the longer a comming, but if you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly abuſe this mercy, even this mercy ſhall be ſhortned; common mercy is ſhortened to deſperate ſoules, as it is length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to common penitents, when they do but commonly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves, that is, as poore brutes, as in the caſe of Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neve: And therefore you have a day of the Lord mentioned by the Prophet <hi>Zephany,</hi> as <hi>haſtened; the great day of the Lord, and haſtening greatly,</hi> to ſuch a Generation of ſinners, as now I am ſpeaking to, <hi>Zephany.</hi> 1.14. <hi>The great day of the Lord is neere, it is neere, it haſteth greatly, the mighty man ſhall cry there bitterly, tis a day of waſtneſſe, mens bloud ſhall be poured out as duſt, and their fleſh as dung the whole Land ſhall be devoured by the fire of his jealouſie, and hee ſhall make a ſpeedy riddance of all them that dwell in the Land.</hi> Your day when it comes will be like this day, a day of diſpatch that will make riddance of you wholly, body and ſoule, and if you ſlight this that I tell you now, and goe on in your ſinne, know that this great day of the Lord haſteth greatly: ſinners, tis neer, tis neer.</p>

There will be ſtormes to morrow; and they are ſo; 'twill be a wet afternoone, and tis ſo. And obſerve how our Saviour makes uſe of all this, to a proud ſecure Generation, <hi>Yea, and why even [of your ſelves] judge you not what is right?

The worme that never dies begins to live, crawle, and ſtirre, here: doſt thou feele it knaw terribly now and then? what and continue in thy ſinne? why, hell certainly is not far off.

               <p>AFflictions are from God immediately, or from man: God ſtrikes ſometimes and uſes no hand but his owne, it is leaſt conſidered when ſo, but not leaſt of importance, for God hath ſome great deſigne upon the man, when hee ſtrikes every ſtroke himſelfe. Sometimes God ſtands behind <hi>Shimei,</hi> and lets fly at a man, and wounds deeply, and then tis not ſo eaſie to ſee him, becauſe an earthen breaſt-work is before him. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he appeares in the front in perſon himſelfe, like <hi>Goliah,</hi> and makes the incounter by duell, hand to hand with the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the creature ſmites and God ſmites, Name, State, Fleſh, and Spirit: God would faine be ſeene and knowne of the ſoule, when he does thus; if it cannot be, he lets the creature lick him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe whole if he can.</p>
               <p>Afflictions from man immediately are here meant, and not ſuch as are from God immediately. Creatures of the ſame kind, are uſed to ſpit in one anothers face, to ſcratch and teare one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: a Cat, a Cat; a Dog, a Dog; a Man, a Man. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the ſame kind (to ſay no more) are uſed to tread upon one anothers toes, to afflict one another. All earth beares thornes, chuſe out what earth you will, ſift it how you will, appoint it to what you will, to be a pillow for repoſe, a breaſt, a boſome, a bed of flowers to ſolace in, yet there will grow up thornes and pricke. Creatures one by creation, one by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, yea one by mutuall election, differ, fall out, afflict one another: man afflictes man, that was <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe here: ſaint afflicts ſaint; husband afflictes wife, wife <hi>curſes</hi> husband; things made and choſen of purpoſe to delight, ſad: thornes will grow in ones boſome here. You cannot take a roſe to ſmell to here, out of any Garden but hath prickles, unleſſe the Roſe of <hi>Sharon.</hi>

'Tis an evill ſpringing from the root of all evill, to wit, covetouſneſſe: <hi>yee kill and [deſire to have.]</hi> 'Tis <hi>a man</hi> of the Earth, ſaith the Pſalmiſt, and hee would be <hi>alone upon it,</hi> though there were no Rivers and houſes in it for delight, but ſuch as hee hath made with the bloud and bones of all ſuch as live neere him. <hi>That the man of the [earth] may no more oppreſſe,</hi> Pſalme 10.18. the word op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, ſignifies to terrifie, and ſo you have it noted in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, intimating what an oppreſſor is, tis a brute that terrifies all that come neere him, to eate or drinke by him, that he may have all alone, and what hee cannot eate or drink he puddles and ſpoiles.</p>
               <p>Oppreſſion is made, <hi>vi, aut dolis,</hi> by force or by fraud, man can uſe both as hee is advantaged, and as his game lies. Parts internall are all ſubdued, by that luſt which rules, and taught to tumble and ſet this or that poore innocent ſoule, for their maſter: Innocency ſleepes the moſt ſecurely of any thing, dreams of no affrighting things, of no injurious uſage, but from Dogs and Beares and Wolfes, from beaſts, not from any man: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency thinkes every man, a man; not a Fox, nor a Serpent, nor a Crocodile; where as an oppreſſor conjureth his wits, his parts, his practiſes, and ſo himſelfe, into all theſe, to catch his prey. Therefore is an oppreſſor imblazed by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in a Lyon couchant, as one lurking for his prey, as one whoſe words are Oyle, yet ſharpe ſpeares, as one who ſhootes his Arrowes in darkeneſſe, and <hi>hits privily</hi> the upright in heart.

face of a man to the World, all by craft and wile ground to ſuch duſt as to choak and cheat the man, that utters them. What fraud cannot doe, force externall is preſſed to ſecond. Oppreſſion commands all within and without, to ſqueeſe out her will where ſhee faſtens; it turnes Iudges into evening Wolfes, Kings, <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> into Beaſts, and gives them Nayles like Eagles-clawes, that is, makes them turne all their externall advantages, to plume and prey upon whom they will: It doth as the Devill where he raignes; there is not a power in Hell, but hee makes a fleſhhooke on't, to teare and torture and fulfill his bloudy will: ſo not a faculty, not an office not any <hi>vires</hi> within or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but by oppreſſion are all made <hi>tormenta,</hi> killing inſtruments, and to know none, no not one like himſelf, a man, no not one like God, but chaine him and rack him. <hi>Thy Princes are roaring Lyons, thy Iudges are evening Wolfes, they know not the bones till the morrow, Zephany.</hi> 3.3.

Cruelty is nothing without ſtrong inſtruments; it can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with ſtrawes, but vex and burne it ſelfe. The Devill is a great Courtier, hee gets among great men, and there hee can ſhew himſelfe as hee is; play the Devill and make great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, rend and teare whom hee will, righteous and wicked; what hee will, body or ſoule; at what compaſſe hee will; Townes, Cities, Countries; ſet whole Kingdomes a groaning, bleeding, dying Parts commend themſelves to place, place ſwells the ſoule too big for any due compaſſ, unleſſe Chriſt bee gracious: oppreſſion is the firſt borne of pride in place, after it comes to the Crowne: 'tis that child that will inherit all the outrage of greatneſſe. <hi>They are great mountaines that do cruſh; Who art thou O great Mountaine before Zorubbabell?</hi> great ſpirits, and parts, in great place.

               <p>Matter of admiration alſo iſſueth from this point. Let's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire two things, the badneſſe of men, and the goodneſſe of God. When wee ſee any <hi>praeternatural's,</hi> any thing that nature did not properly intend, any monſtroſity in a thing, if it bee but in a finger, in a hand, in a toe, much more if in any maine part, which maims the ſhape, and almoſt varies the ſpecies, wee wonder much, as to ſee a Dove with a Bores tuskes: to ſee a Lambe with a Serpents taile: to ſee a man with a mouth and a throate as wide as a Sepulcher, and a Tongue in it, a fire of Hell; and the ſpittle under the roofe of this Tongue, the poyſon of Aſpes, &amp;c. Wee wonder at what nature did never intend; ſhould wee not much more wonder at thoſe monſters which grace did never
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:113418:181"/>
intend? ſuch grace as workes toward man. We meet a thouſand thouſand ſuch monſters fore-mentioned in a ſpirituall ſenſe, and never make one thought ſtand ſtill a jot, divinely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it. Spirituall monſtroſity ſhould affect us much, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold ſo noble a creature as man, and his nobleſt part, to wit, his heart, turned into a beaſt, all his inſide like a Wolfe or a Beare, and onely his outſide, and ſcarce that, like a man. The worſe ſome are, the better others ſhould be to make it up, that God may not be altogether a loſer, in the greateſt and coſtlieſt workes of his hands. A tender heart will admire, ſigh and bleed over a hard. <hi>O Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets,</hi> here is a patterne worth the following. Chriſt beholds a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of bloudy tyrants, ſtony-hearted hypocrites, and he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires, ſighs, mournes over them: 'twere but the diſcharge of our duty, to mourne over this malicious bloudy Age wherein we live. O <hi>England England,</hi> thou that haſt oppreſt to death many brave Prophets and worthies of other rankes ſent unto thee. When others kill and crucify Chriſt, we ſhould ſit like <hi>Mary</hi> and weep over them.</p>
               <p>Wee ſhould admire the badneſſe of men, and the goodneſſe of Chriſt. Creatures in our own skin, and of our own forme, and yet Wolfes and Lyons; how great is the power and goodneſſe of Chriſt, to preſerve his people amongſt ſuch! Theſe wild beaſts differ in their property from all: more boundleſſe, more reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe every way, the more ſhould that power be admired that keepes us. Other creatures of prey, keepe their place, to wit, the deſert; where no noble creatures trade, is there range; they keepe their time, the night is their day. <hi>Thou makeſt darkneſſe and it is night, wherein the beaſts of the forreſts doe creepe forth, the Sun ariſeth, they gather themſelves together, and lay them downe in Dens, Pſal.</hi> 14.22. They are wild creatures, and they keepe a wild place, and a wild time; when and where they may finde prey proper, without injury to more noble creatures. Theſe wild Beaſts before mentioned, goe forth at all times, when the Sun is downe, and when the Sun is up; into all places, into Cities, into Houſes, up to mens bed-chambers, and pull perſons out of their beds, and ſucke their bloud. O the providence of God, that keepes thee, <hi>London,</hi> from theſe Beaſts of prey! that
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:113418:181"/>
hath ſaved thee and thy little ones, from cruel oppreſſors ſo long! This providence is lengthned, and the mercy is by ſo much the more ſtrengthned upon you, the more to be laid to heart. How often have theſe beaſts of prey in great droves, and with open mouthes been driving this way, and the Majeſty and the juſtice of the Lord hath appeared and preyed upon them that would have preyed upon us, fulfilling his word, <hi>He ſhall breake in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the oppreſſor, Pſalm</hi> 72.4. As God remembers his word, ſo we ſhould remember him, and write down his Noble acts upon our doore-poſts, bed-poſts, heart-poſts, to all which theſe beaſts would have come for their prey. Theſe great acts of God prove mercies to men, as laid to heart; evill will returne, and they which have beene ſo often driven back, will be irreſiſtible at length, if he be forgotten which hath done all this for us.</p>

Sacred ſociety is glorious; the Peers of all the world in a body robed, and the great King of all the world in the midſt of them; ſuch a fight as mortall eye never beheld: His traine reaches from Earth to Heaven, the foremoſt are in Heaven, when the hindmoſt are here: I helped you to a Scaffold to view the forepart the laſt day, I would doe the like now, to helpe you to view the latter; that part of the traine, which is going in at the everlaſting doores, but not yet quite in. You may ſee a great deale of State at the doore of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the very hindmoſt ſoule of that company, which are going in there.

We are here troubled with Frogs, and devouring vermin, and the pit out of which they come is <hi>bottomleſſe.</hi> The gates of Hell are wide open againſt the Church of Chriſt here, though they cannot prevaile againſt it: they that take away mens ſoules, come forth freely, in what numbers they will, and goe what compaſſe they will here, all this world over of an inſtant, and get at which hand they will of the beſt people, when about the beſt worke; they will take the wall of the Nobleſt ſoules, and when about the Nobleſt worke, get at their right hand. The Sonnes of God were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and Satan <hi>ſtood at their right hand.</hi> The locuſts below goe forth by Troopes, they are ſo populous in that land of death. <hi>My name is legion, for we are many.</hi> Though but one ſpeake when a poore ſoule is tempted, yet the traine that attends upon this one, <hi>is many.</hi> I believe this roome is full of infernall Spirits, and that not a ſoule of you now preſent, but have a legion of them at your <hi>right hand</hi> jogging of you, though theſe gates of Hell are not ſuffered to prevaile. If there were no intermixing of Satans family and Chriſts in this world, if thoſe evill ſpirits which he hath at home by him, did never come abroad ſo farre as into this world, yet thoſe that are here reſident, and weare the ſame skinne and clothes which Chriſts family doe, are very many. <hi>They that perſecute my ſoule are many,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt.

I have many ſonnes and daughters, ſweet children all, and yet not one but very hardly handled, ſore ſhot at by deadly archers; many are ſlaine, and are not, and the reſt abuſed and vilified as the off-ſcouring of all things; torne with Lyons, and little wormes gnawing and eating up the carcaſſe; pulled downe by great ones, and when down, trod to death by baſe ones. <hi>Rachel</hi> hath not a child but ſits like the Shunamites in her armes, ſighing, groaning and mourning, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of one wound or other, within or without; and I cannot remedy any of this, ſaith ſhe, and this cuts me to the heart; my children are ſlaine in mine armes, ſlaine with the breaſt at their mouthes, yea ripped out of my wombe. Would my children were all in my husbands armes, ſaith <hi>Rachel,</hi> then they would all be ſafe: would he would ſend and fetch me and all mine out of this plundered countrey into his owne city, then all would be well; ſoule well, yea and body well. The world heares little of this noiſe, tis ſo inward, but tis the panting and beating of every good mans pulſe and bowels in a degree. <hi>We which have the firſt fruits of the Spirit,</hi> (where theſe fruits lie, is the noiſe) <hi>we groane [within our ſelves] waiting for the adoption.</hi> For the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? This they had already. The meaning therefore is, for the full fruition of what they <hi>were adopted to,</hi> which is explained in the following words, to wit, the <hi>redemption of our body.</hi> The ſoule goes firſt, to the ſociety above, the body laſt; all is perfect when this comes, therefore is this onely mentioned: which notes that the militant Church groanes and pants after a perfect ſtate, every one ſighing and bleeding inwardly, inwardly earneſtly, <hi>willing rather to be abſent from the body, and preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5.8.

Chriſtians, lay to heart the ſtate of that body whereof yet you are, can you? <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, above the world, and above Satan, is the mother of us all: that body which Chriſt hath upon earth, groaned, travelled with you, and brought you forth; this wombe which bare you, thoſe pappes which gave you ſucke, are now wounded with a thouſand wounds, doe you ſee them? The haire of your mother is torne, her bowels ript up, her blood runnes in every high way; O all ye that paſſe by, have ye obſerved it? Dogs licke the blood of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> yea, the blood of <hi>Rachel:</hi> the Sword of the wicked ſheds the blood of many a gallant man. <hi>England,</hi> a great Parke full of deare ſoules, the pales now plucked up, the game of Chriſt ſhot at by every baſe perſon; many a brave Hart falne, onely a few Fawnes left, women and children crying and ringing their hands for their husbands and fathers: doe you heare them? Mother, where is my Father? when will he come home? Sir, where is my husband? when will he come home? And a laſſe for them, he is at home already, at his long home. Heathens rage on one hand; mothers, children angry on t'other hand; the Boare is abroad, the Fox at home; one puls off the tender Grapes, t'other ſqueeſes and ſuckes their blood; the worke is one, the tailes of all the wilde beaſts in the Land are together, though their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſeem to looke ſeverall waies: one ſhoots at the body, t'other at the ſoule, both poiſon their Bullets, the venome whereof feeds that Divine juſtice which now fights againſt us all, as if it were reſolved to conſume us all, for ought any one amongſt us all can yet ſee. Is not the Church of Chriſt in <hi>England</hi> militant? Men, Devils, yea a God fights againſt it, for the pollution in it. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, you are witneſſes of all this: what doe you in ſecret? doe you mourne for the tearings and rendings of <hi>Joſeph</hi> can you doe it? doe you move according to your condition? Military?
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:113418:184"/>
fight with prayers and teares? doe you finde any aptneſſe this way?</p>
               <p>I aske this, becauſe diſpleaſure ſinkes deepe ſometimes, and drinkes up all Divine moiſture in the ſoule, the wombe of prayers and teares cloſes, withers, and dries up; God ſecretly ſaith, <hi>pray not for this people;</hi> and then good hearts pumpe and pompe, and nothing will come. <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſome ſuch ſecret checke ſurely, when hee broke off ſtruggling ſo ſtrangely for <hi>Sodome,</hi> when God ſeemed to be upon ſuch an yeelding veine; ſecret providence certainely was in it, that he might not yeeld ſo farre as to null peremptory reſolution, which was to make an end of a generation, whoſe iniquity was full. God felt <hi>Abraham</hi> holding him, and cries, <hi>let me alone;</hi> but <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> did not feels God holding him, nor cried, let me alone, Lord, let me plucke a brand out of the fire, let me quench Hell fire once with my teares. Chriſtians, I beſeech you obſerve your ſpirits, the welfare of all is in this point I am now upon, and not in your great Armies abroad, which you ſo much looke upon; if you feele God tying up, and ſtraitning your ſoules, in regard of a <hi>Sodome</hi> which you ſtruggle for, a Land that looks as if it were ripe in all wickedneſſe, and farre worſe in ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances then ever <hi>Sodome</hi> was, cry, Lord, <hi>let me alone,</hi> let me draw buckets, let me make my Study, my cloſet a Bokim, a place of teares, let me quench a fire, that hath almoſt burnt a brave Kingdome to aſhes; let me ſave a Nation, a populous Nation, thouſands, and ten thouſands, thouſands of thouſands, from ſwimming to hell in their owne blood. If I ſhall not pray out, yet let me chatter ſo in thine eares, that fifteene yeeres may be added to the life of three Kingdomes, to ſet themſelves in order to goe hence, to be pilgrims and wanderers to any other part where thou wilt.</p>
               <p>Thus doe your duty, and then ſubmit. We ſhould be affected with our condition, but not caſt down. A ſtate of hardſhip ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates diſcontent, and now Satan hath ſet Heaven and Earth on fire. A man may have a Heaven in his ſoule, when a Hell in his body, if ſubmiſſive ſtill to the will of God: but when fightings without make fightings within, repinings againſt providence, becauſe it doth not jut and jumpe with my will, now all is
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:113418:184"/>
ſlaine, and not till now; Heaven and Earth on fire, body and ſoule killed with a canon from Hell, and all the powers of darkneſſe crying victory. Doe Serpents ſting? murmure not; remember where Chriſts church is, of which thou art yet a member: tis in the Wilderneſſe yet, and but going to <hi>Canaan,</hi> and ſuch places are full of hurtfull beaſts. Be not <hi>overcome of evill;</hi> then miſery diſſolves it ſelfe into ſinne, then God is ſtung, and thou wilt have ſecret blowes for this indeed, where men cannot pinch thee; thou wilt have ſalt throwne where the ſpring of unſoundneſſe lies, and then thy Spirit will burne within thee for ſomething. We ſhould not onely be ſubmiſſive to, but joyfull under the croſſe of our Lord Jeſus. You cannot tell how much mercy tis, to be any of that body, of which Chriſt is the ſoule; if it be but a foot, a bare foot, and ſtill in the dirt, ſtill upon prickes, briers, and thornes; to be any of that company that is travelling to Heaven, though the meaneſt, the hindmoſt, the moſt miſuſed, &amp;c. But you will know when you come there.</p>
               <p>The croſſe keepes off ſome from being of the Church mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, they cannot <hi>militare,</hi> they had rather die then fight, and kill what they love more then Chriſt. Sinne effeminates the ſoule; love any luſt more then Chriſt, and you will die ten thouſand deaths, rather then ſtrike a ſtroke in good earneſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, or diſcharge one Piece with a Bullet, againſt that fort where your heart lies. Satan deales by ſtratagem, ſinners looke to your ſoules: he can kill none that take up Armes againſt him, and ſtand to it; he either betrayes affection with trifles, and makes the ſoule yeeld, and ſo ſtab conſcience, and ſweare a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable peace: or elſe he terrifies the ſoule with corporall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and makes men flee, and all that flee in ſpirituall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, die every one, are cut off eternally by the purſuer. When there are fightings without, there are feares within, <hi>When I came into Macedonia, my fleſh had no reſt; troubles on every ſide, fightings without and feares within.</hi> Men now love their fleſh, <hi>Paul</hi> in this had no reſt, no neither in his ſpirit; he had ſtood to it upon pure principles; Hee wants fellowes in this age of the world wonderfully; The Church of the Lord Jeſus travels, groanes, dies, for want of them. This generation will have
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:113418:185"/>
more then the advantage of truth, to encourage them to ſet forth, to wit, the advantage of time, <hi>quiet time.</hi> Deluded ſoules, when will this be? you ſo dote upon your skin, that you have quite forgotten the ſtate of Chriſts church upon earth, tis mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. You will live in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that you may ſee no warre, that you may ſave your skin, your pompe, your wealth: this your wiſdome is your folly, <hi>Egypt</hi> ſhall not ſave you, the Sword ſhall follow you into <hi>Egypt,</hi> into your Egyptian huts, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings.

There is a Lilly of the Valleys, and a Lilly of the Hils; there is a Church on Earth, and a Church in Heaven. The great King whom we ſubject to, hath a Chappell of eaſe, a Church in his houſe; the condition of this is farre different from that here below: the Lilly of the Hils is another gets Lilly then that of the Valleys, the purſuit of each ſhall be diſtinct, which will demonſtrate the condition, how it differs. The Church which Chriſt hath in his houſe, is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of perfect ſpirits in perfect reſt, triumphing with Chriſt over all enemies. The Congregation above is very big, thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and thouſands of thouſands, from all parts, quarters, and countries, yet all perfect, not one dwarfe in grace, in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, not one <hi>Zacheus,</hi> a perſon of a little ſtature; there are no ſpirits of little ſtature in grace above, though it be all our caſe here; every one is as tall as Chriſt to any ones beholding; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell elſe how to interpret that expreſſion of the Apoſtles, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, <hi>Till we all come into the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Sonne of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi> They that are come to that unity and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety above, are all compleat, their meaſure is the fulneſſe of Chriſt; their demenſions, his <hi>ſtature,</hi> ſo tall, ſo big limmed, ſo faire, and ſo accompliſhed to looke upon.

               <p>Tis a perfect ſociety, and in <hi>[in perfect reſt].</hi> That glorious Church above keepes a perpetuall Sabbath: you know the Law of the Sabbath, both in precept and preſident, enjoyned a totall, complacentiall, and perfect reſt, <hi>i.</hi> a ceſſation from all labour, and application with all delight to ſublime and ſupreame things. Whilſt this law was in preſident onely, and yet unwritten, it held out this compleat reſt; God did not nakedly ceaſe from his worke, but refreſhed himſelfe in the things which he had wrought. <hi>On the ſeventh day he reſted, and was refreſhed, Exod.</hi> 31.17. Now what this refreſhing was, ſee <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.11. <hi>The Lord bleſſed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.</hi> This was his refreſhing after his worke, he had a totall and complacentiall reſt. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this preſident did the precept afterwards ſtrictly runne, as you may read <hi>Exodus</hi> the 20. <hi>The ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord, in it thou ſhalt not doe [any worke.]</hi> How farre this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended you know: they were not to doe any ordinary worke of their calling, no not neceſſary workes for life: they were not to gather Manna on the Lords day, though Manna was all the food they then had, and had it but from day to day. The godly
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:113418:186"/>
which lived under this Law, and knew the ſtrictneſſe of it, would not performe funerall rites for our Lord Jeſus on this day, as you may ſee, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. laſt, <hi>They viewed the body of Jeſus upon the day of preparation, and prepared Spices and Ointment, but reſted upon the Sabbath day, according to the Commandement.</hi> This totall and ſtrict ceſſation from all labour was upon paine of death. <hi>Ye ſhall keepe the Sabbath, for tis holy to you, every one that defileth it ſhall ſurely be put to death; whoſoever doth any worke therein, ſhall ſurely be cut off from amongst his people, Evod.</hi> 31.14. This was for averſion and turning away from things forbidden: on the other hand, application to Divine things, and to holy imployment was as ſtrict: every thought was to be conſecrated to God, and this with divine intention, with delight; the ſtrings were to be ſet very high and to hold it, and to make delightfull Muſicke. <hi>If thou turne thy foot from thine owne pleaſure, and call the Sabbath a delight, Eſay</hi> 58.13. All theſe things doe but ſhadow the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that glorious Church above, they reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and this reſt is a perfect reſt, <hi>they doe not [any worke,]</hi> as the expreſſion before is: they doe not ſo much as dreſſe their owne meat, no nor gather in any thing for meat, all is dreſt to their hand, and ſet before them; Manna is potted up, and ſtands al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies before every one, not any ſinew, not any thought pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtirres about livelihood, all are intenſly, but very delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully applied to the viſion of God, to the contemplation of the Lord of this Sabbath, the grace of redemption that brought them from hence thither, to ſo tranſcendent a ſtate. Their reſt above, tis as totall as complacentiall, as Gods was; looke how he reſted from his worke, ſo doth theſe from theirs. <hi>For if Jeſus had given them reſt (i.</hi> Joſhua) <hi>then would he not have ſpoken of another day, there remaines therefore a reſt to the people of God; for he that is entered into his reſt, he alſo hath ceaſed frrom his owne worke [as God did from his,] Hebrews</hi> 4.8, 9, 10. Now God totally reſted, and then was totally filled and refreſhed, with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation and ſanctification of what he had done; <hi>he reſted, and was refreſhed:</hi> ſo doe they above, they doe reſt and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, ceaſe from all labours, from all that ſpeakes the leaſt paine, and then they refreſh themſelves with the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and what they finde laid up in him for them, and
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:113418:187"/>
ſo are theſe times called by the Scripture, <hi>times of reſting,</hi> they do reſt from their own workes and are refreſhed with with Gods, <hi>(i)</hi> with the viſion and contemplation of him, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it added there, <hi>when the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord, (i)</hi> from the beholding and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating him and his perſon, in whoſe preſence they ſtand, who is the Lord of that great reſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Triumphing together with Chriſt</hi>] That glorious ſociety above, of which we now ſpeake, is a Church triumphant, all diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their banners, all Heaven over, as they that have fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered all enemies. Sinne is quite dead, death and him that hath the power of death, dead: O death where is thy ſting, O Hell where is thy victory? this is the triumphant language in every ones mouth above. Here we are in continuall combate, in perpetuall war, deteſting legue truce, but not able to conquer: but there all are conquerers, and weare their Crown &amp; Lawrells, and make a ſhew of their conqueſt openly, as Chriſt. <hi>David hath ſlaine his thouſand, &amp;c.</hi> Many ſuch triumphant expreſſions are above, for every little one there is as <hi>David,</hi> and ſing his ſongs. There is a petty tranſient triumph here in the Church militant, but 'tis only as it now and then reaches their ſtate above, in any degree of conquering enemies. <hi>And I ſaw as it were a Sea of glaſse mingled with fire, and them that had gotten victory over the Beaſt, and over his Image, ſtand on the Sea of Glaſſe, and having the Harpes of God, and they ſang the ſong of</hi> Moſes <hi>the ſervant of God, and the ſong of the Lambe, ſaying, Great and mighty are thy workes Lord God Almighty, juſt and true are thy wayes thou King of Saints. Revel.</hi> 15.3. this hints to us the manner of their triumph above, (for Saints do the will of God on earth as they do in Heaven) <hi>The Lambe ſings too: they ſang the ſong of</hi> Moſes <hi>[and the ſong of the Lambe]</hi> The head triumphs, and then all the members; Chriſt triumphs in himſelfe, and all that glorious company triumph in him.<note place="margin">Coloſſ. 2.15.</note> 
                  <hi>And having ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, hee made a ſhew of them openly; triumphing over them [in it,</hi>

You know the ſtate of the new Church, is ſhadowed out in the booke of the Revelation by Heaven, and all the lineaments of it, it comes ſo neere to it. The very firſt draught and modell, Revelation. 4. <hi>J was in the ſpirit and a throne was ſet in Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> As <hi>Moſes</hi> was made to come up to the top of the Mount neere Heaven, and God, ſaith the Text, talked with him from Heaven, to ſhew him the pattern of the firſt houſe: ſo <hi>Iohn</hi> was taken up into Heaven, and God talked with him in Heaven, and ſhaped his patterne of this laſt houſe and the affaires of it by Heaven, as that which ſhould come neerer to it, then any yet had done. But this by the way.</p>

                  </label> I have opened to you now a brave ſtate, but all will not, nay all cannot come to it; I wiſh they could. Corruption cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit incorruption: if it be true corporally, it is true ſpiritually, if the uncleane bodies of the Saints, cannot come to Heaven, ſurely the uncleane ſoules of the wicked cannot. Satan hath a ſynagogue too; a great one here, and a greater below, and a great many will go thither; few will believe this, and this is the ſeale of death. The Congregation above is holy, very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but this is not heeded here; but it muſt or no man ſhall ſee God, nor that glorious ſociety which is with him. <hi>Fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the Kingdome of God,</hi> and yet the Lord be mercifull unto the ſoules of men, this is the generall rule by which men walke. Above fleſh for our bloud, we cannot move; 'twill ſink Perſons, Kingdomes, 'twill make the ſociety below wonderful big: What a Congregation hath the Devill in his houſe, but not one at reſt, all at worke hard, tearing, rending, and roſting one another, and yet have no meate nor drink, but the
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:113418:188"/>
flames and fire in which they worke. Have any of you a mind to be of this Congregation? No, why then doe you purſue your fleſh? your will? ſenſe? ſelfe? ſinne? this ſinne, that ſinne, any ſinne, that will ſerve your turne in theſe bad times? The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of this time is terrible, not a ſoule almoſt but undone by it. Heaven and earth ſhake, Church and State crack, the Grave and Hell gape, the glory above forgotten, the dread of theſe cruſh parts, brave parts, yea that which hath gone for brave grace, to nothing, to worſe then nothing: many Chriſtians like <hi>Cacka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rells</hi> change colour, white all the winter, like thoſe fiſh, and ſpotted at ſpring: what with the bloud and filth of bodies, and the bloud and filth of ſoules, ah Lord! what a ſtinke is there in all ſocieties, all this Land over, and yet no body holds his Noſe? all is ſweet as long as any courſe may be ſtumbled on to riſe, and be but to flea the skinnes of the dead, to go fine: will this bravery be admitted above?</p>
               <p>Where do you finde a ſoule that longs and pants, becauſe of all theſe things? O that I were of that glorious Church above! That I did know to what Officer of that ſociety to ſpeake, to helpe me in there! If any ſo inquire; I will tell thee: go to Chriſt, he is the doore by which all enter: hee will ſerve thee as he was ſerved himſelfe, he was Baptized and the Heavens opened; Chriſt will Baptize thee with the holy Ghoſt and with fire, and then the Heavens which containe him till the reſtitution of all things, ſhall open and receive thee. Thou muſt be contented to be Baptized with Chriſts Baptiſme, his ſecond Baptiſme; after both there was a Heaven opening: At his firſt Baptiſme the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens opened, but did not take him up and take him in: at his ſecond Baptiſme they opened againe, and then they received him, and containe him. Thou muſt be contented to be Baptized with Chriſts laſt Baptiſme, if neede be to leave all as hee did, a very Heaven if thou haſt it, as Chriſt did; riches, honours, pleaſures, blood, life, to follow after Chriſt: After ſuch a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, the Heavens will open alſo, and take in thee into that glorious ſociety above. Chriſt ſurely is prized but little, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Congregation is ſo ſmall below and above. The ſinne of the <hi>Jewes</hi> is become the ſinne of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> my heart trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to thinke what will become of us: What ever wee talke of
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:113418:188"/>
Chriſt, and boaſt of his Temple above and below, we bid baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for all. Though Chriſt will take nothing for any thing he hath, yet you muſt come to him with all that ever you have in your hand, and lay it at his feete; thinke nothing too good for him, ſo you may but have him: here is now, ſtate, wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, yea here is body, ſoule, ſelfe, doe with all what thou wilt; drowne all, burne all, if thou wilt, onely rake the aſhes when thou haſt done, and finde my ſoule, that Jewell of Jewels, which cannot be burnt any where, but in thy diſpleaſure, and put it in thy boſome for ever: This is a Goſpell frame of heart, and miſcaries not: all the Jewels which Chriſt weares in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome above, are raked out of aſhes here below, out of meere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things. His beloved is one, but one, a <hi>Phenix,</hi> and it comes out of aſhes, learne to lay all in the duſt, if you would have Chriſt take up all, and lay it in his boſome.

All this World is afire, it lies ſo neere that below it; every houſe in a blaze; there are ſuch lightnings and blaſtings from that region of darkneſſe, that not a ſoule upon earth but is black burnt, and in danger to be conſumed: they had neede beſtir them that worke about quenching internall flames, which take hold here: this is our worke to quench Hell fire.</p>
               <p>Two things are incomparably ſwift in bringing forth, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt affection and Divine wrath. The time is ſo little betweene conception and birth, in order to ſinne, that it's not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Luſt when it hath conceived brings forth ſinne.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſay that it brings forth in ſo many Moneths, or in ſo many yeares, two yeares or the like, as Hiſtorians ſay the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant goes; but when 'tas conceived it fals in travaile preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the ſoule cannot ſleepe till it bee delivered. The wrath of God is juſt ſuch another wombe, conceives and brings forth preſently, internally or externally, upon ſoule or body, or both; a ſparke of fire no ſooner takes, but it burns preſently within the houſe, though you do not ſee all the out-parts of the houſe in a blaze preſently; a houſe is a fire a great while, before all the Towne cry, Fire, fire. Wrath kindled but a little (as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeakes) in Gods breaſt againſt any man, it burnes preſently againſt him, though not viſible preſently, it ſulters and takes more and more hold ſecretly, and breakes forth all in a blaze in a ſhorter or longer ſpace, as tempeſts and windes ariſe, and as wiſdome will. Spirituall Offices are ſhaped and injoyn'd in order to theſe nimble bearing wombes: <hi>Goe quickly make an atonement,</hi> wrath is begun, ſaid <hi>Moſes</hi> to <hi>Aaron.</hi> If wrath be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, as if he had ſaid, I know the nature of it, 'twill quickly make a diſpatch of all, therefore beſtir thee, be a <hi>Diaconos,</hi> a diligent ſpeedy Officer, take a Cenſer and fire from off the Altar, and put out one fire with another.</p>
               <p>The nature of our Office, hintes the nature of your conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 'tis very dangerous; of a ſudden, ſinners, you are undone: it ſhould be laid to heart. Sinners are damnable venturous, not knowing the wayes of God; they make nothing of ſinne, and
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:113418:189"/>
yet the wages of it is death, and paid preſently. The ſoule fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and wilfull, of a ſuddaine diſpatched. <hi>Say unto the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael, Yee are a ſtif-neeked people. J will come up into the midſt of thee in a moment, and conſume thee, &amp;c. Exod.</hi> 33.5. Chriſt is our Breath and Life, when reſiſted our Breath and Life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, and leaves the dead corps to be ſtretched out, coffined and buried, when juſtice will. Chriſt and the ſoule parted, this is death; other things, as laying the man in his Grave, and ſuch like, theſe are but buſineſſes about the Funerall. Sinner, Chriſt woes thee, doſt thou regard him? He tels thee of the Harlot thou haſt in thy boſome: doth thy ſoule riſe againſt him? Why, turn thy face to the wall, draw up thy Legges in thy bed, thou wilt have a death-pull preſently; conſcience will ſting thee ere thou art aware; and now Chriſt is ſetting foot in ſtirrup to be gone, he is now throwing off the duſt of his feete, as a preparative to departure. Chriſt hath put the Knife now to thy throate, yea more, he hath ſtabbed thee to the heart, and thou bleedeſt inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, what wilt thou do to ſtop and heale this wound? Didſt thou dreame of a dart in thy heart, ere thou hadſt done thy ſport? to be ſhot from Heaven in the act of ſinne, in the boſome of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilah?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 'tis not ſo with mee: though I eate forbidden fruit now and then; yet it agrees well enough with me, it doth not make tumblings and ruptures in my bowels. Death ſeiſeth not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all alike; ſome goe away in a ſwone. Inſenſibility is the deadlieſt condition of all. Chriſt diſregarded, the ſoule is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded, in the hower that one is the other is; whether it now roare or bee ſtill, all is one, Chriſt is, departed, there is no divine Life in the man; you ſee but a corps, not a Chriſtian, which will be buried out of Gods ſight quickly. The winde blowes where it liſts, how it liſts; of a night, of an inſtant it turnes and blowes againſt one, that was with one, and drives the Veſſell upon Rockes, and ſplits all. A ſinner is nobly and ſweetly intreated for a ſeaſon, this deſpiſed, the old one leaves the neſt, hee cannot hatch what hee ſits upon, and therefore that ſtranger which hath blowne upon the egges, and chilled them with handling, let him ſuck them too now, or teare them, or do what hee will with them. I beſeech you
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:113418:190"/>
ſinners know your day, your hower: if the Sunne would kiſſe you, kiſſe him; He wooes hartily, yet not in ordinately, as ſome Lovers doe, that will never give over, that die when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtaine. Chriſt kils others that will not love him, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver kills himſelfe with love; he can of a wooer, become a ſlayer of you, and all in one day, yea in one hower. Wherefore receive that holy word, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.36. <hi>Let your Loyns be girded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, ſaith hee, and your lights burning, and yee your ſelves like unto men that waite for their Lord, when he will returne from the wedding, and when he commeth and knocketh they may open to him [immediatly.]</hi> If you thinke out of pride and ſtoutneſſe to make Chriſt waite your leaſure, till you have taken your fill of forbidden things, and gone on as far as ever Nature and Life could let you goe, you will be deceived; Chriſt will in this caſe leave knocking, and only marke the doore, and be gone. Some are hard to vomit, there is ſuch a concinnity betweene the ſtomack and what filth is burnt to the coates of it; twill goe hard with ſuch. Some caſt up preſently as ſoone as nature is offended. So do you ſaith Chriſt, open <hi>immediately,</hi> what I knock for to be delivered up, deliver it up imediately, I will not waite.

We place bleſſedneſſe here, tis not here, twas here, but is not now, tis riſen, tis above, there muſt your induſtry lie. Seeke thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt is at the right hand of God. The mercies of Gods owne family make us, and none elſe, Such diſpenſations as have the ſpeciall love of God wrapt up in them. Let no man thinke this an unpoſſible thing to attaine; the things that are above will <hi>come down</hi> to the conſervation of the whole; the naturall Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens will deſcend, the ſupernaturall will too; Chriſt, though at the right hand of God, will come down, and ſit at your right hand, and guide you, and impart the things that are above to you; clothe you in the habit and faſhion of that countrey, if ſought to, and deſired. But the plague is, our hearts are carnall, and luſt onely after low things; we place bleſſedneſſe in our belly, and worſhip Dagon, <hi>Dagan frumenti Deus,</hi> a belly-god; The Apoſtle alludes to this, where he ſaith, <hi>Whoſe God is their belly.</hi> Red pottage luſted after, the birth-right is nothing. How affection workes, is not heeded by you, yet your life is in it, and it goes to the heart of God to ſee how you laviſh and lay it out, for that which is not of any nobility or worth, in order to ſuch creatures as you are. Wherefore doe you ſpend money for that which is not bread? not white bread, not living bread, not that bread which came down from Heaven, not ſuch as the family a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove feede on.</p>
               <p>You that feed on ſuch mercies owe much to God; I will touch this, and conclude. You that are like <hi>Joſeph</hi> Nazarites among your brethren, ſeparated from thouſands of your owne fleſh and bone, and made great, endowed with Noble gifts, and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Noble workes, to attend upon the great King of all the world, as his onely favourites, your ſhould doe as <hi>Joſeph.

Choice endowments call for choice duty, as we are winged we ſhould mount. There were <hi>choice vowes</hi> under the old covenant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.11. Some choice offerings that upon ſome choice mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies received, they performed to God. You have received choice mercies, make <hi>choice vowes,</hi> (underſtand me Goſpelly) make ſweet Goſpell raptures of all Noble favours received. Your Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man dames had ſome Jewels worth millions; which they called <hi>uniones,</hi> becauſe they were incomparable and had none like them, <hi>ſingulars,</hi> ſuch as had no fellowes, and theſe they bequea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed when they died, as an inheritance to poſterity, they were of ſo great worth.

               <p>THere are two occult things in providence, which when well apprehended, make a ſerene ſweet life; to underſtand ſtill wherefore God takes, and wherefore he gives, what bitter and ſweet meane; blindneſſe in either, loſeth God, God loſt in his dealings, the ſoule loſeth it ſelfe, a man knowes not in this caſe where he is, nor what he is, whether a Saint or an hypocrite, a man or a beaſt: In both theſe, this ſervant of Chriſt was acute: the periſhing of the outward man, the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing of the inward, he could explaine both. <hi>All things are for your ſakes,</hi> 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 4.15, 16. there he ſpeakes of what miſery he did beare, here in the text I ſtand upon, he ſpeaks of what ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he did beare, and he underſtood well the end of both, both for the Church of Chriſt, <hi>for you, i.</hi> for the proſperity of Chriſt, in the hearts of all believers.</p>
               <p>Family diſtribution is with this deſigne, that all the family may be the better for what any one hath. An elder child that can tell how to hold a diſh, hath a great full meſſe, that all the reſt may ſit round and eate out of his diſh. Wiſdome folds up many things in one, many vertues and influences in one Sunne, for all the world: ſuch a Sunne is Chriſt, ſet for the <hi>fall and riſe of many.</hi> We are in Chriſts ſtead, and ſo the ſavour of life and death to many.

If you ſee Angels ſent forth, thoſe glorious gifted creatures, you may ſtand ſtill and propheſie where they will turne in, to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Lot;</hi> they may goe along by others, but they turne in and hoſt here. The choice communcations which deſcend from Heaven, they bed themſelves in the breſts of Gods people, they may hang and hover in the braines of others, but they enter into the hearts of none but theſe. The life of Chriſt is the ſpring of all parts; the gifts which you ſee ſhine in any; they are but ſprings from this fountaine, branches of this Vine, and obſerve which way this Vine creepes, about whoſe houſe ſides it goes with its branches, into whoſe bowles he ſqueeſes their blood, <hi>Tis for you,</hi> ſaith he, this is the blood of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was ſhed <hi>for you.

                  </label> Towards whom Chriſt doth thus apply himſelfe, twill be bad bending againſt them for any. This generation is very unhappy; men obſerve not which way Chriſt bends, and bend after him, but which way the times bend, and ſo bend after theſe, and ſo what parts and endowments God hath given them, are imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt the people of Chriſt, and not for them. One thing ſhould by as us, to wit, the will of Chriſt; but when this will not, any thing will, pride, covetouſneſſe, malice; when a man hath loſt his aime, he kils a child, a friend, as ſoone as an enrmy. The ſcope of divine diſtribution, this ſhould be every gifted mans aime, from hence ſhould we take our levell, but we doe not. Which way doth God looke? To what point hath he ſet the compaſſe? To what part hath he bound me, and fraighted me? for the Holy-land? for Saints? muſt all I have, and all I can doe runne into their breaſts? and put in at their Haven? Then thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I muſt ſteer, and to no other port, though greater gaine might be had: if this I doe not, I make ſhipwracke of faith and a good conſcience. This is the plague of this generation, faith and conſcience ſhipwracked, which is the fruit of an ill ſcope at firſt, and the proper medium of a wicked proceſſion: what will not that man doe againſt truth and Saints, which hath ſplit his

peace and fidelity with God. Parts and principles miſcoped, render the perſon worſe then they that have none, more heady and high minded, and now the man ſets himſelfe in a way that is not good, and this goes to the heart of God, he often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines of this. The more God is inraged by any courſe, the more ſeverely he ſmites the purſuer. Hypocriſie is puniſhed with pride, envy, and ſecurity; and now is a next neighbour and a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar worſe then an open enemy, more bloody. <hi>I was a reproach among mine enemies, [but eſpecially among my neighbours,] Pſa.</hi> 31.11. vicinis valde, <hi>to my neighbours very much, or moſt of all.</hi> Tis of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate iſſue every way, to ſoule and body, not to ſoder in ſcope with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians ſhould ſucke this honey-combe well, a fathome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe depth of ſweetneſſe is in it: the bent of Chriſt in all his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations is toward you, his heart hangs after you; affliction, proſperity; warre, peace, Magiſtrates, Miniſters, <hi>Paul, Apollo, Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> life, death, all is yours, <hi>for you.</hi> Things now thwart much, man againſt man; nothing againſt you. We looke too low to ſucke the ſweet of this point, and to be at reſt in troublous times. Inferiour agents looke one one way; another, another way, and anſwerably oppoſe in their motion, and kill in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and yet the firſt intention lives and obtaines. The ſcope of the firſt agent in all ſhould be eyed, and reſt. What is Chriſt about? To deſtroy his people? to deſtroy his glory? Againſt whom, or for whom is he? Is he for <hi>Babylon</hi> and Babyloniſh wretches, which now warre againſt us? Is he ſo in his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in his purpoſe? poſſibly this or that particular action, as we ſcan it, may looke like as if it were for them; but is the prime ſcope of God for them in all he does? does his heart hang to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward any Babyloniſh brats now afoot? abroad or at home? If you thinke ſo, read <hi>Jeremy</hi> 50.31, 32. <hi>Behold I am againſt thee, O thou moſt proud, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts, for thy day is come, and the time that I will viſit theel, and the moſt proud ſhall ſtumble and fall, and none ſhall raiſe him up, and I will kindle a fire in his Cities, and it ſhall devoure all round about him.</hi> How ever actions and proceedings ſeem to ſmile upon evill men, yet let this beare us up, the ſcope of all is againſt them. <hi>I am againſt thee.</hi> i. in my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and plot. And contrariwiſe, however ſad and blacke
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:113418:194"/>
things may looke in mans view, in order to Chriſtians, yet their ſcope and their intention is for them: Chriſt is for his Churches, and for his Saints in all his deſignes. This was that which <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> deſired to know when he was in ſome feares, which way Chriſt heart did bend when his Sword was drawn, whether for them, or for their adverſaries, let me but know this, ſaith <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and I ſhall reſt, let things worke how they will, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 5.13, 14. <hi>And it came to paſse when Joſhua was by Jericho, that he lift up his eyes and looked, and behold there ſtood a man over againſt him with his Sword drawn in his hand, and Joſhua went unto him, and ſaid unto him, Art thou for us, or for our adverſaries? and be ſaid, Nay, but as a Captaine of the Hoſt of the Lord am I now come, &amp;c. Or for our adverſaries, coarctatoribus, for them that ſtraiten us,</hi> which word ſpeakes full to our condition; there be a great many bloody wretches abroad, which <hi>ſtraiten</hi> us exceedingly in all our mercies, which pen us into ſo few Counties, and into ſo little trading; yet it ſhould be enough for us to know, againſt whom the point of Gods drawne Sword is ſet, whether againſt their hearts, or ours; whether to make an end of them, or of his people, which party Chriſt takes; if you thinke he takes their ſide, no, <hi>Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You may ſucke this point not onely to eſtabliſh you againſt feares and dangers now apparent, but to furniſh you with all excellencies that Chriſt hath. <hi>Sampſons</hi> heart was ſet towards <hi>Delilah,</hi> and ſhe knew it, and made uſe of it to get out all, to ſtrip him of all; not a ſecret about his Nazariteſhip, but ſhe gets it. Now we know the bent of Divine affection, that it is ſpecially toward us, we ſhould make uſe of it to get out all the ſecrets of wiſdome and holineſſe, that are in Chriſt. So you know Chriſt when he had fiſhed out this to the botome, that <hi>Peters</hi> heart did indeed bend and incline ſpecially towards him, he makes uſe of it to draw him out to ſpeciall and Noble ſervice for him. Doeſt thou love me ſaith <hi>Delilah,</hi> then ſhew me this, and that; ſo ſaid Chriſt to <hi>Peter, Doeſt thou love me?</hi> and is all thou haſt for me? then let me ſee it, <hi>Feed my Lambs, and feed my Sheepe:</hi> ſo doe thou
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:113418:194"/>
ſay to Chriſt, Doſt thou love me O Chriſt? and doth thy heart bend principally towards mee? And is all thou haſt, and doſt, for me? Then let me ſee it: feede my poore ſoule with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, tis very ignorant: feede my poore ſoule with love, with joy, tis very low and ſad. If what thou haſt given this Miniſter and that Miniſter be for me, why do I profit no more by them? my Teachers drop pretious things, but I like a broken ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

If thy boſome O Chriſt be a lodging intended for me, hung ſtately and perfumed ſweetly for me, why cannot I lie there alwayes? Clouds and miſts are ſcattered by the force and motion of celeſtiall bodies; you that are celeſtiall creatures; it muſt ſtir up the grace of God in you, and move and act the forcible acts of faith at the Throne of grace, if you would diſpell the clouds that hide God and great good from you. Vaine beliefe deſtroyes us; not one Chriſtian of a thouſand ſetled in this, that the Heart of God is toward him, and therefore hath no heart to goe to him, to make uſe of him, no nor cannot reſt upon him for any thing.</p>
               <p>It cannot be that the heart of God is towards mee: all things go againſt me. Sinne prevailes, conſcience ſtings; breaches within, breaches without; lively-hoode dies, feathers fall off apace, I am almoſt quite bare in the neſt; I know not where to get cloathes to put on my back when theſe be done, no not where to get bread to put in my head, when this in my hand is eaten. My wife mournes, my children cry, friends frowne: lively-hood did I ſay? nay Life it ſelfe becauſe of all theſe, is almoſt gone: tis as much as my heart-ſtrings will hold, I ſigh ſo oft, and ſo deep, and can the heart of God be towards me? can all be for me, and all againſt me?</p>
               <p>The Heart of God how it inclines, cannot be gathered from the hand, no not from the Tongue of God. When a man would make demonſtration of his ſtate by the hand of God towards him, hee had neede weigh things well, the wheeles that go over have ſo many eyes, and looke ſo many wayes, one ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived alſo. God can ſpeake againſt a man and do againſt him, (as you call againſt) and yet all that while yearne in heart over him, and working about great things for him, he can ſpeake
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:113418:195"/>

Chriſt ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſharpe troubles, killing and bloudy trials, ſaith, Feare not him that can kill the body; and then comes on thus, to ſhew the tender providence and bowels ſtill work, in ſuch times when we thinke not. <hi>Are not five Sparrowes ſould for two far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things? and yet not one of them is forgotten before God, but even the haires; of your head are [all] numbred feare not therefore, you are of more value, &amp;c.</hi> Pretious perſons ſometimes, according to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall condition, are of no worth, ſpoild, bought, ſold, for naught, five of them for <hi>two farthings,</hi> and yet not theſe, not one perſon, no not one haire of theſe perſons forgotten <hi>(i)</hi> not without the compaſſe of tender bowells; their haires num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, when upon their head, and when they fall off their head.</p>
               <p>Tis not ſafe to calculate kindneſſe by the meere motion of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, or of ones own heart. Straites and trialls put weake creatures to it, Chriſt is not extreme to obſerve in this caſe. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine compaſſion dies not ſo ſoone as we thinke: tis an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thing, tis a child of mercy which indures for ever. God in all caſes of tranſgreſſion lookes upon Chriſt ſtrictly, then his fury is ceaſed; this ceaſed, whatſoever God does is conſiſtent with bowels, tender bowels. The bittereſt things that befall us ſhould be ſo conſtrued, by looking ſtill to Chriſt as God doth. The Lord ſpeakes of the <hi>piercing Serpent,</hi> and <hi>Leviathan</hi> the <hi>crooked Serpent,</hi> and the Sea Dragon, <hi>Eſaia.</hi> 27.1, 2, 3. and all theſe in his Vineyard, and ſuffered them all to make terrible worke, and yet when hee comes to redreſſe this ſaith, that <hi>fury was not in him all this while;</hi> they did quite miſtake him that did judge theſe ſad afflictions, the fruites of a heart turned againſt them.

Sacred conſtitutions, are not ſtuffed with hay, ſtraw, ſtubble, things that hold forth onely to ſenſe ſome humane fading thing; they are all of ſupreame authority, and hold forth ſomething of God and nothing elſe; ſome pure beame of the Sun ſhines in every ſacred Ordinance. There were many ſorts of inſtruments about the Tabernacle, and yet not a pin but pointed at ſome great thing: ſome pointed at the wiſdome of Chriſt, ſome at the power, ſome at the mercy of Chriſt; ſome noted the back-parts, ſome the face, ſome the body, ſome the bloud, ſome the Life, ſome the death, ſome the dying-breath of Chriſt, to wit the word.

                  <hi>Chriſt, we breath in your faces:</hi> the nature of this I will open to you, what it is naturally, what accidentally. Naturally tis pure, perfectly pure. There are three regions of Aire, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though one purer then another, yet none perfectly pure. 'Tis a diviſion that pleaſeth Schollers,<note place="margin">Pure.</note> but the ſubſtance is one. So we may diſtinguiſh in this matter in hand. There be three Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions in that Aire that blowes and breathes upon our ſoules, the breſt of the Father, the breſt of the Sun, the breſt of the holy Ghoſt, all pure, perfectly pure, theſe are perſonally diſtinguiſhed, but one in eſſence. As things are, ſo they breath Lungs and inwards rotten, and breath is anſwerably corrupt; cleane things come not out of the mouth of uncleane, wickedneſſe proceeds out of the mouth of the wicked; perſons when they are dying, their breath is moſt of all impure, all parts within are ſo over-run and ruined with filth; Chriſt was dying all that time hee lived a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and yet ſound in all parts,; holy, and ſo breathed to the laſt, he gave up his laſt breath in Hell, and yet holy and heavenly: and therefore very apt and punctuall is that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Solomon [Every word] of God is pure, Prov.</hi> 30.5. Chriſt never had any filth in his mouth, the fountaine that gave ſpring to that out-let was ſo pure; hee never ſpake a ſinfull word: if <hi>every word</hi> of Chriſt was pure, then his dying words were pure, his words in Hell <hi>Eloi, Eloi, &amp;c.</hi> And yet this is not all the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis of that Text, <hi>every word of God is Tſerupha, purgatus, purified, Surmo purgatus.</hi> 'Twas a Hell that Chriſt did ſpeake in, all his time here below, if this Hell did do any thing, it did purge and not pollute his words, hee <hi>learn'd obedience not diſobedience,</hi> by all he underwent; it ſet him more in Heaven, and made his expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from more inſpiration, his breathings forth in this world, from ſtronger gales from that world above, and made his laſt words, like the laſt words of that ſweete ſinger of Iſrael, <hi>doubly ſweet:</hi> How tranſendently ſweete are all thoſe expreſſions in the Goſpell of <hi>Iohn,</hi> which hee ſpake as preparatory to his end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

It ſounds pleaſant, taſts pleaſant, lookes pleaſant, &amp;c. The breath of Chriſt caſts a dew <hi>[thou haſt the dew of thy youth]</hi> that hangs
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:113418:196"/>
the Locks of man with ſilver drops. The Aire in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries doth colour and varniſh the haire. Words in ſeaſon are like Apples of <hi>Gold in pictures of Silver,</hi> theſe are ſhining things indeed, and proper to the ſight, ſuch are all the words of Chriſt his laſt words were very ſeaſonable words without which, where would have been this Ordinance, and theſe words, which now you partake of? the gales that come from Chriſts mouth, are all ſeaſonable; let this winde ſit which way it will, and blow how it will, ſharply, or mildly, tis ſtill ſeaſonable; Chriſt is wiſdome, and wiſdome never breathes unſeaſonably, and ſuch words are as the Sun, irradiant beyond the glittering of gold, or ſparkling of Pearles, to the internall eye. Wiſdome makes the Face, the Tongue, the Lungs, yea the breath ſhine, which is a wonder.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The breath of Chriſt, as it is pleaſant to ſight, ſo to taſte, this is another wonder. <hi>Ephraim</hi> is derided for <hi>feeding on wind.</hi> Can one taſt or eate winde? Yet ſuch is the breath of Chriſts Lips, that one may feede on 't, like the Dewes of the holy Land, and make a very good meale, tis ſo ſweet to the taſte, and ſo nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing to the ſtate of the ſoule: the breathings of Chriſts Lips are beyond expreſſion pleaſant to the taſte. <hi>How ſweet are thy words to [my taſte!]</hi> I cannot expreſſe it, as if the Prophet had ſaid, <hi>yea ſweeter then the Honey to my mouth: Pſal.</hi> 119.103. they that write of Honey, tell us of ſeverall ſorts, which the Bee makes at ſeverall ſeaſons, and anſwerably differ in their ſweetneſſe, and goodneſſe. There is a Honey which they call <hi>Flower-honey.</hi> which is made in the Spring and prime of the yeare, from choyce flowers, and this is accounted the prime Honey, and that which they judge beſt to nouriſh young Bees withall, when they are firſt put to worke, to put them in heart. The breath of Chriſt is Honey-dew, his words are combes full of <hi>Flower-honey;</hi> gathered out of the Garden above, and admirable to put yong and old in heart. There is a great diſpute about Honey-dewes, whether they come from the Earth, as exhalations from it, as other ordinary Dewes do, or not: ſome affirme it to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a pure ſweat of the celeſtiall bodies, an unctuous gelly, from the benigne Starres, and therefore called a <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liquor,</hi> and ſay, if it could be taken as purely as it falls from
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:113418:197"/>
the Heavens, before it comes into the corrupt Aire in which we breath, 'twould be much beyond that which we have, it would be a ſoveraine Nectar, to cure all diſeaſes, it would fetch from death to life, and immortalize men. There may be ſomething in all this, though not ſo much as authors would have us think; and yet if all this were true, tis too ſhort to ſet out the thing in hand. The honey dew wee ſpeake of, tis no exhalation from any thing here below, tis indeed, nothing elſe but the ſweat of Heaven, an unctuous gelly dropping downe from that bright morning Star Chriſt, the ſweat of his celeſtiall body, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is ſoveraine for all diſeaſes, to fetch man from Death to Life, to immortalize men; Chriſts Words are <hi>Words of eternall Life.</hi>

                  </label> Tranſgreſſion is much aggravated by this point. Sinne is hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily loved; nothing will turne men. Do you conſider what you go againſt? you go againſt the breath of God, the dying breath of our Lord Jeſus. Some mens bowells are all torne out; ſuch are paſt recovery. When Satan can ſerve any ſoule ſo, the caſe is very wofull, and yet this is common. Sinners have you any ſoule-bowells? will not a crying, dying, groaning voyce, work upon you? The miniſtration which is here below is glorious, but dying; it hath been ſo, tis ſo, 'twill be ſo. The Prophets, where are they? The great Prophet, Chriſt, where is he? The Apoſtles where are they? they that Preached to your fathers, where are they? we that now preach to you, are we not dying? is not every light waſting? Is it not warme dying breath that is now breathed in your faces by me? Are not the lights of this Generation almoſt burnt out? and yet ſinne more alive then ever it was. This World worſens apace: this Generation, the dregs of many paſt. Speake who will, cry, die, who will, Chriſt, and many thouſands more, yet ſinne muſt not die, no, not open ſinne. What a Sodome is London and England, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of God! this aggravation kills us, this makes our carcaſſes now that they cannot reach the Sepulchers of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but bed horſe feet, and the wrath of God. That place is worthy of note, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.21. <hi>and hee cried to the man of God which came from Judah ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord, for as much as thou haſt diſobeyed [the Mouth of the Lord]</hi> Obſerve the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:113418:197"/>
of aggravation, <hi>and haſt not kept the Commandement which the Lord thy God commanded thee,</hi> but cameſt back and haſt eaten bread and drunk water, in the place of which the Lord did ſay unto thee, Eate no bread and drink no water, thy carcaſſe ſhall not come into the Sepulcher of thy fathers. He had cried againſt the Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and againſt <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> this hee diſcharged well, but he was alſo not to eate nor drinke in that place, to have nothing to do with any there, becauſe of their pollution, and this alſo he obſerved well a while, as appeares by his ſtout Language to the King; <hi>If thou wilt give me halfe thy houſe J will not eate Bread with thee in this place.</hi> But he was fetched back by a flattering Prophet, and did eate and drinke in <hi>Bethel;</hi> and ſo went againſt <hi>the Mouth of God.</hi> The Prophets obedience was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall, his carcaſſe fell for this ſadly: tis our caſe, at beſt, for the generall. Such whom ſinne doth not wholly ſway, neither doth truth. Thoſe that are againſt the Altar at <hi>Bethel,</hi> are for eating and drinking in <hi>Bethel,</hi> for countenancing ſomething forbidden about Gods worſhip; mens carcaſſes pay for this and will, till they know how to account of every tittle of what a God ſpeaks; till we become faithfull executors, of the will of a dying Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, we ſhall die.</p>
               <p>We live in a very unhappy time; we are ſpectators of ſinne and juſtice in height Men prize their ſinne above their bloud. But as ſinne is feated, ſo it will abide: if ſinne be feated in the heart, it will abide there, till all the bloud of the man be ſpilt on the ground, yea, till all that which is ten thouſand times more noble then this, to wit, the ſoule, be loſt. I will tell you the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the Word of God, in order to ſuch a foule, as ſtill keepes his ſin, tis though ſweet in it ſelfe, bitter to ſuch; ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, piercing, tormenting. The word of God is quick and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, ſharper then any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding of ſoule and ſpirit, and this hee ſpake in order to them which abode in the ſtubborneſſe of their heart, and flighted the promiſe of perfect reſt, in that <hi>Canaan</hi> above. The heart ſtrongly ingaged to evill, truth is very piercing: he that ſo loves ſinne that he ſlightes the reſt above, he ſhall have no reſt here. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine the ſad boutes and fearfull expectations, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound ſoules have, and yet this muſt continue, becauſe the
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:113418:198"/>
breath of the Lord like a River of Brimſtone, keeps in this Hell, as it doth that below. The breath of Chriſt which you ſpurne againſt, by your ſpurning, lights a fire, and ſhall ſerve to burne you, though it will not to lead you. Chriſt puts to the ſword all they which yeeld not, burnes and blowes up all that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take. <hi>Did not our hearts burne within us whilſt he talked with us?</hi> The breath of Chriſt is hot, it burnes within men accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that degree of unbeliefe and reſiſtance it findes, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, without reſpect of perſons. <hi>Did not [our Hearts] burne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sinners conſider theſe things and repent, ſucke in the dying breath of Chriſt, charge folly upon your ſelves. Who is it that ſpeakes to mee? what would he have? who is it within me that anſwers, and what anſwers doth it make? There are fleſhly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, and carnall motions, take heede of them. Everybody will plead for it ſelfe, the body of death will do ſo, which is the death of the ſoule, but methinks the Word of God ſhould ſilence all; If the voyee that ſpeakes to us were conſidered as ſuch a voyce, ſurely it would. In what poſture your ſoules ſit in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, is all in all; If you thinke I ſpeake theſe things <hi>as a man,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that it is onely a mans word, you will huſh your ſoules aſleepe againe, as ſoone as gone from the preſence of a man: and yet ingenuity would honour <hi>mans voyce.</hi> The beaſt that ſpake to <hi>Balaam</hi> that beaſt, was honoured to ſpeake with <hi>mans voyce,</hi> and that was throwne in <hi>Balaams</hi> face, that mans voyce from a beaſt would not calme his madneſſe. <hi>The dumb Aſſe ſpake with [mans voyce].</hi> But when man is honored to ſpeak with Gods voyce, and to forbid your ſin and your madneſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, will you on for all this? how much more will this be throwne in your face? Conſider with what voyce we ſpeak, and for how little while this Oracle ſpeakes in this earthen Tabernacle, and ſee how it will worke. <hi>To day if you will heare [his voyce]:</hi> this Tabernacle in which <hi>his voyce is</hi> and ſpeakes, laſts but a day; <hi>to day,</hi> if you will heare <hi>his voyce</hi> ſinners, doe; to morrow the tent will be removed, the vaile will be drawne, the Oracle will beſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <hi>his voyce</hi> and our own too, will be gone out of our Mouthes, and hid from your Eares.</p>

Chriſt can put out the Eyes of a <hi>Sampſon,</hi> darken the greateſt lights, and confound the greateſt parts, that is ſpeake ridles and parables at every word, things unexplicable to the moſt learned men; he can carry a darke Lantherne betweene the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> make a cloud to go betweene both, and to be darke of one ſide and light of to'ther: Chriſt was in the midſt of that project, 'tis often ſaid in the Booke of <hi>Moſes</hi> that hee was in the <hi>midſt of the cloud,</hi> that is, he was the onely author of that great myſtery; 'twas no art of <hi>Moſes</hi> nor <hi>Aron,</hi> nor any man elſe, but Chriſt.

               <p>A Goſpel ſence of miſery, is the firſt ſtep to remedy. Light is made to ſhine out of darkeneſſe; God cloſeth the Eyes, and then opens them. I am at the doore of Heaven, neere the Kingdome of God, my night will have a day, according to the courſe of of the Sun, it will be ſo. Let faith thus work, and thou wilt be bleſſed ſpeedily.

darke firſt; very darke and very ſad; and then reveales light ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cleere, and makes a very ſhining bright Heaven. The order of the Sun what courſe it goes, what long nights it makes in ſome parts of the World, and then what long and glorious dayes, ſhould be remembred and expected; this way comes in our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe here. In a darke condition, when one cannot do as wee would, we muſt doe as we can, make advantages of little things. <hi>Sampſon</hi> being darke and ſtarke blind, made advantage of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boy; <hi>do thou,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>lead mee to this place</hi> or that, to the <hi>pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar where the houſe beares;</hi> ſo muſt you poore darke ſoules, which are ſtarke blind in the beſt things, makes uſe of ſuch little things, as before mentioned to be led by, till you come to finde Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, great Pillars whereon the houſe beares, to doe great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits.</p>

               <p>THis expreſſion meanes not <hi>totum</hi> but <hi>tantum,</hi> not altogether hid but very much hid, over what it is ſince the revelation of Chriſt in the fleſh. A full comment upon theſe words are thoſe of the Apoſtles to the <hi>Epheſians cap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 4, 5. Whereby when you reade, you may underſtand my knowledge in the myſtery of Chriſt, which in other ages was not made knowne to the ſonnes of men, as it is now revealed to his holy Apoſtles and Prophets by the ſpirit. Ceremonies were but a ſhaddow of good things to come, as great a diſtance between their condition and ours, as betweene ſhaddow and ſubſtance: their fruit had much ſhell and little kirnells: we have no ſhell, yet the kirnell bigger and ſweeter to. The ſenſuall helps they had, ſpake for the moſt part no farther then ſence. What all thoſe carnall Ordinances did ſpiritually meane, we have in expreſſe words, and theſe words explained and applyed, with greater power and glory then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, from the ſpirit of Chriſt. Mercies have their demenſions, they differ in grouths. The drops that fall from Heaven, are of ſeverall quantities, Chriſt hath in his hand bleſſings of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſizes, ſome bigger, ſome leſſer; two talents, five talents, ten talents, concerning the glory above, tis diſputed whether it be graduall, but concerning the glory of a Chriſtian here, it is a reſolved thing that it is graduall: there is migration in our glory here, going from glory to glory, from ſtrength to ſtrength; Milke and ſtrong meate, babes and full age, crums and Flagons, love and <hi>abounding in love. Our Kingdome comes,</hi> our Kingdome here is a comming Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Mercies are all ſhaped by Love, it is the property of Divine Love, to higthen diſpenſation ſtill, till ſhee hath lifted the ſoule beloved fully into her boſome. Grace tis in the beginning lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, a <hi>grai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

and now ſhe reſts and not till now; beyond Heaven there is no gradation, no ſtep higher; Love hath got her full end, which is the full poſſeſſion of what ſhee makes out to, and now reſts. Love ſhapes Mercy ſo, as fully to bring about her end, and that is to bring the ſoule ſhee loves into her boſome, to the full frui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her ſelfe, of whatſoever ſhee is; you may ſee this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in Chriſt: the Father loves him, and he gives him mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies greater and greater, and never leaves till hee hath lifted him fully into his boſome, to his right hand, <hi>(i)</hi> the fruition of all, <hi>John</hi> 5.20. <hi>The Father loveth the Sonne and ſhoweth him all things that himſelfe doth, and hee will ſhow him greater workes then theſe, that yee may marveile.</hi> My Father hath given me great things already, but hee will give me greater, for he loves mee; and this will drop and drop till it hath dropped out all, it will never reſt till it hath brought mee into his boſome. The love of God car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the ſame property and proportion to a Chriſtian, and this makes the grouth of a Chriſtian neceſſarily, as the grouth of a Crocadile, of which it is written; that hee groweth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, ſo doth a Chriſtian, till hee bee tranſplanted into Heaven.</p>

Your graces are not ſo great but you may have greater; if this be not regarded, as you taſte not grace what tang it has, ſo you underſtand not grace, what order t'as. Spirituall fulneſſe ſpeakes a deluded heart; hee that hath goods enough, enough for many yeares, enough to make his felicity for ever, and therefore reſts, is a <hi>foole,</hi> hee knowes not his ſtate, what hee has nor what he wants. Blinde men 'tis obſerved, do not dreame ſo much as men that ſee, becauſe fancy in the day hath not ſo much nor ſo lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive imployment to ſet it at worke in the night; but blinde ſoules dreame more a great deale then they that ſee; This is one of their dreames among many; I have enough grace to bring me to Heaven I hope, and I care for no more, I love not to be pragmaticall. Some make a great deale of ſtir and run mad; tis extreame naught this, I like it not.

cold? grace in the true knowledge of it is inviting, 'tis like ſome Liquids drinking makes thirſtineſſe and longing for more drinke; every degree of grace poſſeſſed, makes diſcovery of greater degrees not poſſeſſed; One Chamber of Chriſt hath a window looking into another far bigger and more glorious. Thou art entered into one thou ſayeſt; doſt thou looke into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother more glorious, and long to enter into it? if thou be a ſtranger to theſe things, thou art a fooliſh Virgin, that poſſibly haſt knocked at the doore of Chriſts houſe a little, but art yet indeed entered into no roome; when Chriſt had opened the nature of ſpirituall bread unto his followers, that they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed underſtand it, they fell a longing preſently for more; what they had, diſcovered much more behind which they wanted, and therefore cryed <hi>Lord evermore give us of this Bread.</hi>

                  </label> This point is upbraiding; the light which ſhines upon us, is more glorious then that which ſhined upon our Fathers; that which hath beene hid from Ages and from Generations, we have made manifeſt to us; wee have mercies according to externall communication of the biggeſt: what have you according to internall communication? this will be looked after. This is a day of great things, a time wherein Chriſt brings about great things to our doores; our fathers day was a day of ſmall things; yet if they were judged for deſpiſing their day of ſmall things, how much more ſhall you be judged that deſpiſe the day of great things? tis the Apoſtles argument to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> and muſt be mine to you. Deſpite is a ſpiritull act, deliberate diſaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the lovelieſt things. The poſture of our ſpirits wee leaſt looke at, and this Chriſts Eye is moſt of all fixed upon. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall carriages are all meaſured, and titled from the heart. God rules in the inſide of his enemies, hee unbowells this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and Chriſtens it in blood, according to its ſpirit. We offer deſpite to the ſpirit of grace, we tread under foot the bloud of the Lord Jeſus; can wee tell whether this iniquity will be blotted out till this Generation die? The heart fired againſt truth, abides ſo; tis part of that unquenchable fire below; God allowes Satan to bee fueler in ſuch a ſoule, till they both come to burne together in hell. Love loſt, Chriſt cares not for the perſon, let him be what he will, if hee be the greateſt man in
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:113418:202"/>
the World, he will burne to death in that fire, which burnes in his breaſt againſt Chriſt. Our love now to be leaſt, when grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt love is tendered, can you imagine that this iniquity will be quickly forgotten? great heare makes great thunders, tis ſo now; the Sun of love ſhines mighty hot, and now wickedneſſe thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and ſo will Juſtice and righteouſneſſe too; believe it.</p>

The Apoſtle encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> tells them, they had ſuffered ſuch things <hi>from their owne Country men,</hi> and compares them that did it, unto the <hi>Jewes</hi> which crucifyed the Lord Jeſus, and <hi>their own Prophets, who pleaſed not God and were contrary to all men, forbidding to ſpeake to the Gentiles that they might be ſaved, filling up the meaſure of their ſinne alwayes, [whoſe doome obſerve] for wrath is come upon them to the uttermoſt.</hi> The alluſion here made plainely ſhewes, that theſe bloudy wretches were men of parts, <hi>noone Devills,</hi> as one of the ancients calls them, or <hi>mid-day Scorpions:</hi> tis written of this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he is moſt apt to ſtrike and ſting at noone, when Sun beames are brighteſt and hotteſt upon him. Innocent bloud ſhed by day light, ſpeakes conſcience feared, and conquered, and this is the laſt power that gives up in the ſoule; Divine Life is quite gone when this is gone; the laſt breath gone, is not ſucked in againe. Conſcience twiſteth cords and binds the ſinner, to keepe him in
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:113418:205"/>

Conſider ſinners what fire burnes in your breaſt, and with what fuell, and you may gueſſe whether it be unquenchable fire or not, of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that below, which by decree is to burne for ever: you are perſons of parts; the great dangers we ſpeake about, lies moſt amongſt ſuch as you. Truth is hindered in its courſe every where by you, within and without, in your ſelves and in others; for you to be opoſites and adverſaries to all men, to all good men and to all good things, perſons and things of the nobleſt nature, tis very ſad: write Lord have mercy upon ſuch wretches, at their doore; wrath is come upon them <hi>to the utmoſt;</hi>

                  <hi>to the end,</hi> that is, which will make an end of thee: thy ſoule burnes with ſuch a Feaver as will kill thee for ever. This generation hath a deadly countenance in my eye; mens hands are ſomething tyed up now by common diſtreſſe, but with the tongue we are killed all the day long; men ſpit blood which is a ſad ſigne, and they moſt which pretend moſt to more then ordinary knowledge, and yet are <hi>brute beaſts</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeakes in many things, and ſpeake <hi>evill of things they know not,</hi>

                  <hi>who ſaith he, ſhall utterly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in their owne corruption.</hi> This is ſo certaine that it is called an <hi>evident token of perdition,</hi> by the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>Matter of admiration and thanſgiving, might alſo be ſuckt from this point, if we had time to lie longer at the breſt; though all men forſake Chriſt, yet ſhall not Chriſtians utterly; one might go this way and make ſweete Muſick. Our mercy is eternall; our miſeries but for a moment. Chriſt doth but hide his face, when he ſeemes moſt out with us; he doth not caſt off, nor put away, he hates that in order to his Spouſe: though he give her to the Rod, yet tis not to the black Rod, to a fatall ſtroake. Our prime mercies are married to us, which is as ſure as the being of any thing will afford; a marriage Knot holds we know, till the very being molders, which thing ſhould take us much: it much tooke <hi>Solomon</hi> that God had ſpoken well of his houſe for a great while.

The Goſpell is nam'd according to its nature, <hi>a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery; Moſes</hi> vailed to a carnall Jew, Chriſt vailed to a carnall profeſſour; a Sunne ſhining full in the face of thouſands, and yet onely ſeen by one or two of them; one in a Tribe, two in a City; one in the midſt of many, and yet ſeen but by one: <hi>There is one in the midſt of you, whom ye know not, whom ye [ſee not,]</hi> thats the originall, <hi>John.</hi> 1.26. This is a myſtery indeed: this title was given in the verſe before, and then opened.</p>
               <p>The ſubject of the Goſpell is here ſpecified, and amplified: ſpecified, to wit, Chriſt, <hi>Which is Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> The Goſpell hath <hi>Moſes</hi> vertue in her boſome, he had one ſat in his boſome which did wonders; <hi>wither and reſtore.</hi> Put thy hand into thy boſome, ſaith God, and when he tooke it out his hand was <hi>leporous as Snow.</hi> Put thy hand into thy boſome againe, ſaith God, and he did ſo, and behold his hand was <hi>turned as his other fleſh, Exod.</hi> 4. 6, 7. <hi>Moſes</hi> had a notable one, which ſat in his boſome; the ſame hath the Goſpell, and can doe as he did, to wit, put hands and hearts into his boſome, and make them leprous, and white as Snow; that is, make perſons ſee their filth, and cry out, unclean, uncleane: and then can put theſe very leprous creatures into his boſome againe, and bring them out white and ruddy, <hi>incarnate Roſes,</hi> as that of <hi>Sharon</hi> in the Goſpell: the Goſpell is the poole, that hath no leſſe then an Angell, the Angell of the covenant ſtirring and healing cripled creatures in it; tis <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſda, a houſe of effuſion,</hi> of the braveſt liquid blood and ſpirits in the world, to wit, Chriſt crucified, this is the ſubject of the Goſpell.</p>

they delighted much to lie by ſprings and fountaines: therefore Chriſt cals for <hi>praying evermore, and rejoycing alwaies;</hi> he loves to have ſalt water and freſh, teares and triumphs, freſh motion of ſoule ſtill ſpring out. Therefore when he comes to refreſh thirſty ground, he doth not content himſelfe to ſay, that it ſhall have the former and the latter raine, and dewes from Heaven every night, though this be much, <hi>but that the parcht grounds ſhall become a poole, and thirſty lands [ſprings of water,] Eſay</hi> 35.7. <hi>it ſhall be thus:</hi> his pleaſure is to live by wells and ſprings, pooles that bubble up continually.</p>

What the Scripture ſpeakes of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man, that in an oppoſite ſence may I of the ſpirituall. Man is borne to trouble and vexation, as the ſparkes to fly upward; ſo is a Chriſtian, borne to delight and pleaſure: he is a ſparke alwaies flying upwards, and entring himſelfe in Heaven. Motion keepes warmth, warmth keepes health, health is the baſis of all delight and pleaſure. An healthy perſon makes muſicke and mirth with any thing. Motion alwaies towards Chriſt, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sunne, I am ſure keepes warmth and health; our wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and annointing of Chriſt, tis workes ſweet to ones ſelfe, as well as to Chriſt: all graces are freſh and thriving whilſt wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with ſighs and teares after more. A ſpirit ſound and healthy within it ſelfe makes all things without, how broken, ſickly, conſuming ſoever, matter of content, joy, and praiſe. A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian whilſt laying out, whilſt filling his box with precious Oyntment, powring it out upon Chriſt, he doth make a ſweet odour all the houſe over, he refreſheth Chriſt, his brethren, and himſelfe.

Such hungry ſoules which are as empty ponds, gaping as it were to Heaven with wide mouth for repleniſhing, the Heavens open and fill theſe. Raine ſignifies grace and the miniſtration thereof in the Word. <hi>Drop downe ye Heavens from above, and let the skie poure downe righteouſneſse, Eſay</hi> 45.8. that is, let Chriſt poure downe grace upon ſoules that are as thirſty Land, which are as <hi>Daniel,</hi> perſons full of deſires.</p>
               <p>As deſirers to know and gaine, are ſuch bleſſings to themſelves, ſo to the Land wherein they live; tranſparent things are not only their owne beauty, but the beauty of things that are neere them: the ſparkling of a Pearle is not onely its owne beauty but the beauty of the ring and the finger on which it is.

How contrary to right judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to the welfare of this Land are they that ſeeke not after God themſelves but ſeeke after lies, and hate and perſecute them that doe otherwiſe, and labour to poſſeſſe authority that ſuch as are deſirous to know more of the Lords will, and are earneſt endeavourers to doe it better and better, are the onely overthrowers of the Land, and therefore worthy to be throwne out on't.

               <p>ANy mercy, any thing that is or imports the leaſt kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to man now, may be called riches, riches of glory, at ſuch a great diſtance is man now from God. But the Goſpell is great riches, to wit, as much as man hath loſt, and more; it ſets man as high as ever he was, and higher, which is riches of glory indeed, conſidering how glorious once man was. It muſt be a great deale to ſet up a broken man; but to ſet him up higher then ever he was before fallen is glorious riches, <hi>i.</hi> unexpreſſeable.</p>
               <p>The Goſpell in the intention of it is nothing but love. <hi>A voice of joy, a voice of gladneſſe, a voice of the Bridegroome, and a voice of the Bride, a voice of them that ſhall ſay God is good, and his mercy endures for ever, Jeremy</hi> 33.11. This is the Goſpell, and you ſee that there is nothing in it but joy and gladneſſe: the Goſpell is a ſalutation of love, of the ſweeteſt love, it holds forth bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoming love, <hi>i.</hi> marriage love, <hi>a voice of the Bride, and the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome,</hi> ſaith the text, <hi>i.</hi> the ſtrongeſt love, glorious love: it holds forth love not to laſt for a little while, but to laſt as mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage love, yea to laſt longer then that can doe, <hi>mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during forever,</hi> ſaith the Text, which is rich and glorious, that will hold its ſtrength and its warmth; its a breaſt and boſome worth the being in, that will never be cold.</p>
               <p>The Scripture uſeth three words, which will fitly ſerve to open this expreſſion in the Text, what glorious riches the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is. The Goſpell is <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="471" facs="tcp:113418:209"/>
him, but onely the Goſpell; not with any matter of hope; any other Volume no ſooner opened but man reads his doome in every line.</p>
               <p>The booke of the creatures opened, which is a great Volume, and yet not a line in it that ſmiles upon man; nay any one may better looke into the booke of creation then man; man no ſooner lookes into this Volume but all the creatures fall a blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding preſently, as having eſpied their murtherer: thou haſt murthered me ſaith one creature, and thou haſt murthered me ſaith another, and this is the bloody tone to the very teeth of man throughout all the creation. The gronings of the whole creation are throwne as it were by each creature in the face of man, they all hold up their hands together againſt man and ſay, this is he that hath deſtroyed us. There is not a ſinner upon the face of the earth, but is in ſome degree in <hi>Cains</hi> caſe, beſet with all the creatures, every buſh ready to fly in his face, to ſcratch and accuſe him; all the creatures are out with huy and cry after man as their murtherer, which was the reaſon why <hi>Cain</hi> was ſo fearfull everywhere he came, the whole creation was up in an outcry againſt him. Man is the prime creature miſerable, and yet the prime creature cryd out upon to be more miſerable: man is not miſerable enough yet; let me overwhelme and drown all ſaith the Sea let me not leave a man alive ſaith the deepe. Let me open my mouth, and eate up all the men in the world, ſaith the earth. Let me breake forth and burne all, ſaith the Heavens. There is a ſtrong propenſity in all the creation, to make an utter end of man, without the leaſt compaſſion towards him in any breaſt. There is a joynt conſpiracy in the creation, juſt as there was in <hi>Noahs</hi> latter time to ſwallow up all, and the creation ſhall obtaine its will upon all, the wicked world at laſt, and when that time comes you ſhall ſee what Goſpell is in the creation; not a dram of mercy ſhall any wicked ſoule finde; ſo will Heaven, and earth, and the deepe conſpire. And as for the Law, that is a Volume which heigthens all this cry, and avers the juſtice of the creation in its cry, and cries out for blood ſtronger then it.

               <p>The Goſpell being riches, prize Chriſt and his Miniſters; let them be glorious in your eye, which bring glorious things. Know which way the riches of glory comes to you, it comes but by one gate. Which puts me in mind of a ſtory; In the County of <hi>Saba</hi> which ſignifies a myſtery, when Frankinſence was brought into the chiefe City thereof, it was ordered by the Prieſts that it ſhould come in but at one Gate upon paine of death, to wit that which they had conſecrated for that purpoſe. Tis of lively uſe, the riches of glory come in but one way, by
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:113418:212"/>
Chriſt and by the Miniſtry of his Word, and therefore keepe open this Cate; if all the money in your purſes will do it, if all the bloud in your veines will do it, let all goe rather then this and the Goſpel; when this departeth the <hi>glory departeth, the riches of glory departeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is but one thing that is eminently acceſſary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the riches of glory, and that is hardneſſe of heart. The Balme-Trees when they had wounded them to get the vertue of them to drop forth, they laid Wooll upon which the drops might fall, that ſo they might be ſure to ſave it; ſo to gaine the riches of the glory of the Goſpel, to ſave the drops that fall from Chriſts mouth, you muſt lay ſoft hearts, tender and fleſhy hearts; otherwiſe you will die poore and miſerable, notwithſtanding all the riches of glory that are amongſt you.</p>

               <p>A Gentile in the ſpirit, is one ignorant, <hi>without God in the World,</hi> that is, without the knowledge of God; it is explained ſo by another expreſſion like this, <hi>that at that time, yee were without Chriſt,</hi> being Aliens, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.12. And by another expreſſion <hi>to them that are without the Law as without the Law,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.21. that is, ſuch as had no knowledge of the Word of God, nor did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge any ſuch thing as a rule of life, but their own blind traditions and cuſtomes. Gentiliſme is a meere Chaos, a little World lying all in confuſion, darkeneſſe upon the face of the deepe; the underſtanding which is as the face of the ſoule, blind, not able to finde out God in his Word or Workes, what in eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, or what in exiſtence, what hee is or what he doth, in Heaven, in Earth, in the ſoule of man, nor what hee will doe, though all theſe expreſt, and told of at large; a Gentile in ſpirit is one that cannot ſee God nor <hi>feele after him,</hi> that can uſe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head nor hand, no reaſon nor ſenſe divinely; one that fits in darkeneſſe, and cannot ſtir any power internall or externall, towards the true God. <hi>One that fits in darkneſse,</hi> wich is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion I thinke in alluſion to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who had thicke darkeneſſe, ſuch obſcurity of darkneſſe as the originall ſaith that they ſaw not any man his brother, neitheir roſe any man from his place for three dayes <hi>mittacheaif de ſub ſe, not from under himſelfe, or not from off himſelfe,</hi> and theſe were Gentiles, and in this, I thinke, the lively type of all Gentiles, who are in ſuch thick darkeneſſe ſpiritually, that they ſit ſtock ſtill, not one can ariſe from of himſelfe, to apprehend any thing out of himſelfe, and above himſelfe; that which hee worſhips is himſelfe, the imagination of his own brain; his zeale is ſeated in blind prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,

               <p>A Gentile in ſpirit is one blinde and obſtinate, he ſhuts his eyes againſt ſome things and none muſt open them, opens his eyes to other things, and none muſt ſhut them: he loveth darkneſſe, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then light, and no body muſt ſtir nor wake his love till hee pleaſe; this obſtinacy is well expreſt by Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. <hi>if hee [will not] heare the Church,</hi> let him be as a <hi>Heathen,</hi> an <hi>Ethnick</hi> which is the ſame word, with the Text I ſtand on; if <hi>hee will not heare,</hi> let him be accounted a Gentile; a Gentile, is a wilfull perſon.

               <p>Spirituall gentiliſme is opened; have I not done two works at once? opened the Doctrine, and opened your condition? are ye not Gentiles in heart, though not ſo call'd? truth ſhould be own'd whether with us or againſt us, or there is no remedy: confeſſion of ſinne is a neceſſary Goſpell requiſite, ſinners can have no mercy without it; if ye lay not open your ſinne to God, twill lay open you to God, Angels and men; and a ſoule laid open by the word, is one found out in the fact; when God hath found out and ſeiſed upon a ſinner, for him then to deny the fact or ſeeke to breake away from him, as one that breakes bolts, by being more boyſterous in ſin, this man will die for it, and not have pardon, no not hope on't, hee'l not have his booke; there is not the leaſt tender of grace to the ſoule, whilſt convictions are ſtrangled, but treaſuring up wrath againſt the day of wrath, to burne hornets in their neſt, ſeeing they will not come out: convictions ſtifled is like Powder in a mine, that when ſprung it blowes up all, and no fire ſo terrible as this ſtifled fire, for renting, and tearing the ſoule. A mans ſoule diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by truth, God hath found out the man, the effect will be this, the man will now prove a deare friend, or a deſperate enemy to Chriſt, the viſion of convictions make a man fall at

               <p>'Tis a mean place, 'tis an uncleane place that Chriſt chuſeth to ſit down in here, and yet this is not all, 'tis a place much haunted, which is the laſt particular, which ſpeaks the forlorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a place: you take but a fancy that this place and that is haunted with evill ſpirits, and you will not ſit downe in ſuch a place for all the world: this is reall and no fancy concerning your ſoules; there is no place in all the world, hell excepted, ſo haunted with evill ſpirits, as the ſoule of man, that room with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us. <hi>Come out of the man thou unclean ſpirit,</hi> ſaith Chriſt; and Chriſt askt him his name, and he ſaid my name is <hi>Legion,</hi> for we are many; but how many? that the devill himſelf could not tell,

or would not, <hi>Mark</hi> 5.9. The inviſible world is more populous then the viſible: you have an innumerable company of evill ſpirits haunting one ſoule: the numerouſneſſe of diabolicall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits infeſting the ſoule, is hinted by that ſimilitude of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, comparing them to Fowles that flock to their prey; <hi>Some fell by the high way, and the Fowles came and gathered it up,</hi> ſaith the Text:<note place="margin">Rev. 16.14.</note> There be flocks of Crowes, and Rooks, and Ravens, and black fowle in the aire. And then, they are called Locuſts in the Revelation, a creature more populous then any: Hiſtory writes of them, that they foreſee a famine, and then leave ſuch parts, and flee in ſuch a mighty company, that like a great thick cloud they darken the Sun for a great compas, that whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys of people ſee them as they flee, and fear leſt they will light where they live, and devoure all. There is another title given to diabolicall ſpirits, to note etheir populouſneſſe in the purſuit of the ſoule of man; the devill is called <hi>Beel-zebub,</hi> an <hi>Idol,</hi> or <hi>God of flies,</hi> intimating that thoſe evill ſpirits that haunt our ſoules here, are as thicke as ſwarmes of flies. There is another Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſpeaks to this point, <hi>Math.</hi> 7.21. <hi>This kinde goes not out, &amp;c.</hi> There are it ſeems <hi>divers kinds of evill ſpirits.</hi> The reſult of all is this, Chriſt uſeth a very forlorne ſeat in this world.</p>

Can a hell praiſe God? Can the grave praiſe Chriſt? The Scripture ſeems to put an impoſſibility upon what I exhort to. I am exhorting the grave to praiſe Chriſt, that hee would come there: if it be poſſible let the grave praiſe Chriſt, let your ſoules which are the ſpirituall graves of Chriſt, open their mouthes and make a reſurrection of him and of his love, that lies there. Take up <hi>Hannah</hi>'s ſong, <hi>The Lord killeth and maketh alive, he bringeth downe to the grave, and bringeth up; the Lord maketh poore and maketh rich, he bringeth low and lifteth up: He raiſeth the poore out of the duſt, and lifteth up the beggar from the dung-hil to ſet them among Princes, and to make them inherit thrones of glory; for the pillars are the Lords, and he hath ſet the world upon them, &amp;c.</hi>

               <p>DIvine things at a diſtance have their influence upon the ſoul; a word of heaven ſets the ſoul a longing and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it, and this is called hope. Hope ſpeaks an heire under age, knowing his inheritance, and expecting poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion; writings are throughly read, propriety plainly found out, evidence about the man, yea evidence <hi>in him</hi> to ſhew: Chriſt <hi>[in you] the hope of glory.</hi>

               <p>As corporall nouriſhment paſſeth through ſeverall concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the laſt the nobleſt, ſo doth ſpirituall nouriſhment: Hope is the laſt concoction of the ſoule, the laſt digeſtion of words and workes, by which pure bloud, ſpirits, ſubſtance and ſtrength is delated and defuſed all over the ſtate. The Scripture makes three concoctions, as Nature doth corporall, and Hope is the laſt; <hi>Tribulation worketh Patience, Patience Experience, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience Hope:</hi> and now the ſpirit hath ſpirit, hath it ſelf, <hi>ſtrength, ſetledneſſe,</hi> therefore it followes, and hope <hi>confounds not.</hi> Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence toumbles the ſoule, and the ſoul toumbles providence, and the firſt reſult of this is patience, the ſecond reſult experience; what God is at preſent; and in the breaſt of this ſits hope, what God will be, and ſmiles: till things worke to this laſt iſſue, the ſoule is <hi>confounded,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="489" facs="tcp:113418:218"/>Hope ſucks the ſweet of the words and works of God to the bottome: that which lyes in the bottome of all, God ſaith and doth to a Chriſtian, is heaven, what ever lyes utmoſt; the end is eternall life ſtill to a Saint, what ever things are a this ſide. Things looke variouſly ſometimes to a neare ſight, and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite repugnancy betwixt words and works, between ſuch an end, and ſuch meanes ordained to it, and yet all in an ultimate interpretation, carry an exact ſubordination to the ſoules high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good. Hope is a great Peere privy to the depth of wiſdome, to the intentions and reſolutions of God, and to the harmony of all changes and turnings, how, when, and where they will meet in ſuch a bleſſed end, and lies, and bathes, and ſports her ſelfe in the conſiſtances of all varieties with and towards her prime good: 'tis a grace to which felicity is alwayes in view, a halcyon that findes out a quiet place upon the moſt moving and boyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous body, to wit, the ſea.</p>
               <p>Hope, tis a ſoul free from a Conſumption, fat and merry, eates not out its owne ſpirits, nor its owne marrow. Some kinde of Spiders eate out the Dam which ſits upon them, as ſoone as hatcht: ſo do the thoughts and apprehenſions of ſome ſouls kill the minde and ſpirit that brings them forth, they are ſuch poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous and eating things, they are ſo venemous, ſo fiery, ſo dark, ſo gnawing, ſo voyd of heaven, of any glimpſe of it, and ſo full of hell, <hi>I reckon upon my afflictions from morning to night,</hi> ſaith <hi>Hezekiah, and I have cut off mine own life; his ſoule</hi> hatched ſuch thoughts in time of diſtreſſe, as did gnaw out the bowells and. life of it ſelfe, that affliction became as death, and death as hell, which is the property of deſpaire and unbeliefe, to render perſons as deſtroyed and <hi>damn'd already,</hi> as that expreſſion is. As there be ſoules damn'd already, and in hell already, ſo there be ſouls ſaved already, and in heaven already: in heaven, whilſt loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for it, apprehenſion of it in Chriſt ſo ſtrong, ſo clear, what ever accidentals turmoile the outward man the while. <hi>Accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that the long-ſuffering of the Lord [is] ſalvation,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. tis a ſoule that hath ſo clear an apprehenſion, of the iſſue of all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings for Chirſt, that the iſſue of them is in him already: what he expects is to him already in a degree, in judgement and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>judging that the long-ſuffering of God [is] ſalvation;</hi> yea

I am very induſtrious to inſtruct, to propagate wholſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I ravell out my Lungs, my Reines, my Braines, my life, and yet he ſees not this ſilver cord, to be led to any thing by it; ſay what I will, doe what I will, all dyes at the doore, equity <hi>will not enter, Rectum non potuit ingredi,</hi> 'twill not goe in; they were ſo crooked, that right things and ſtraghit things could not be made to goe in: Thus you complaine, and thus you ſee God complaines; he is ſenſible of painfulneſſe and ſucceſſeleſeneſſe as you are. The Metaphor is taken from denſe obdurate things, as ſtones, earth, which are ſuch things of all other, that light can make leaſt entrance into. The earth is the moſt deading and repelling body of reſplendency of any body: They that are but a little way under the earth, are darker many fathome, then they that are under water, becauſe Sunne-rayes can enter this bodie, and make light downe to the bottome, though very deep. As 'tis with bodies under earth, ſo 'tis with ſoules: worldlings, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy wretches, your ſoules are under earth, you are in great dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and light cannot come at you.

there are great damps, which put out all the light that is brought in; know therefore what God complaines of: God bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened with any ſoule, that ſoule can be in no good conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a ſoule in utter darkneſſe, I meane, in ſuch darkneſſe where no light can come, is abuſed both by fancy and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; deluded, tormented, and finall and fatall wrath brings up the reare. In darkneſſe, fancy is a brave light, an approved guide; and alas what conception of divine things this makes! Chriſt is I know not what, and I know not from whence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing that the ſoule will, any thing that ſinne will to make a long life for it ſelfe in the ſoule. <hi>We know whence this man is, but when Chriſt commeth no man knoweth whence he is, Joh.</hi> 7.27. What a ſtrange Chimera is Chriſt to fancy! a big nothing! to carnall apprehenſion Chriſt is ſuch a one as comes no man can tell whence. Fancy raiſes things ſo high, that no body can ſee them; this tumor in the ſpirit, 'tis ſuch profound wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that it turnes man into a foole, and God into nothing. <hi>The foole hath ſaid in his heart there is no God.</hi> He doth not ſpeake ſuch words formally; but his fancy reſolved, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of God rightly expreſt, ſpeaks God <hi>no God (i.)</hi> they ſpeak ſuch things of God as are inconſiſtent to ſuch a holy being, and ſo deſtroy God.</p>
               <p>God murdered, his bloud cries in mans conſcience; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall light is made to torment, when Divine light cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; The higher rejection of God, the greater guilt falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Conſcience; this is not all: The light a man hath in this caſe, ſhall not ſerve him ſo much as to ſhift with, to evade the Huy and Cry of Conſcience, but be arm'd againſt a man, and quickly to take hold on the Felon ſo guilty, and very reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and irreſiſtibly give the ſoule up to conſcience, ſhift how it will, or how it can. <hi>Shimei</hi> was a rough-ſpirited man, and hid from the Hue and Cry of his owne conſcience ſome ſpace of time in that buſineſſe about his dogged carriage to <hi>David,</hi> wherein he reſiſted ſome divine beames: but what they were, and how many, and how big, and bright, I know not: all his carriage in that bad buſineſſe he called <hi>perverſeneſſe,</hi> and againſt his <hi>Lord and King;</hi> and was himſelfe of the <hi>houſe of Joſeph,</hi> and therefore 'tis probable had ſome principles of

Did not <hi>Shimei</hi> know that he had ſinned before now? that he had rejected <hi>David</hi> as King, and ſo in him Chriſt? No doubt: but he made ſhift to hide things from Conſcience till now, now his light was quickned and ſtrengthned upon him, and would ſerve to darken things no longer, but to brighten and to cleare them, and ſo irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtibly, and with ſtrong hand to give him up to the purſuer; and thus will all your light ſerve you, who reject the cleare light of the Goſpell, and reſt in other dark lights.</p>
               <p>The light a man hath and abuſes, to keep out more and better light, Chriſt will make this in the concluſion, to give up the man to conſcience; now is the man delivered up to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary indeed, which is called in the originall <gap reason="foreign">

Children come to the birth &amp; cannot be delivered, or elſe delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red too ſoon, untimely births are not taking to looke upon none lodge ſuch in their boſomes. Indiſcretion turnes the point and edge of things that otherwiſe are very penetrating. The words of the wiſe are like goades and nailes, they goe into the heart: wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome takes the utmoſt of all advantage, which is very forcible, ſhe ſits her down in the center of a buſineſſe, and takes into her boſome all the ſmall lines that doe circumſtance it, and ſo makes her motion in every thing effectuall, heart-reaching, and heart-working. The heart is put for wiſdome in the old Teſtament, and I thinke for this reaſon, becauſe wiſdome is that which brings in all to the heart, words, workes, that which makes every thing like goads and nayles, piercing, or like honey dewes, ſo king, melting. Behold God is mighty, and deſpiſeth not any, <hi>he is mighty in ſtrength and wiſdome,</hi>

                  <hi>tis ſtrength and heart, or ſtrength of heart.</hi> Wiſdome is that which brings in things in ſtrength to the heart, and ſo makes it ſtrong upon the heart. Strength and wiſdome are joynd together here, things that we ſay or doe are of ſtrength, as this conjunction is kept, which is never ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in order to God.

The civill State, and the Divine, doe as the ſoule and body ſympathize; as the one proſpers ſo doth the other, twas noted a great while agoe worthily by good Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> upon the burning of ſome Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in <hi>Norwich,</hi> the ſame yeere there followed ſuch a fearfull fire, as almoſt burnt downe the City: where note, ſaith he, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtate of the Church ſo is the Common-wealth, in adverſity or proſperity: burne Saints, and Chriſt will burne Cities, Countries, Kingdomes; tis conſiderable therefore to obſerve, how we take in or caſt out the Word of God.

               <p>I will open this latter to you.

                  <hi>gaudio gaudet,</hi> by joying or in joying, he joyeth; he is in good earneſt, his joy is a reall joy, a joy that takes the whole heart. The Greeke word alſo ſignifies to bid farewell; the Word of Chriſt got into the heart, the Bridgroomes voyce heard in the ſoule, makes ſuch a joy and ſuch a delight, that the ſoule bids farewell to all ſinfull mirth, and cals it madneſſe; yea, it bids farewell to all other delights comparatively, and cals them vanities, empty things, if not ſinfull things, vexing things, and ſo polluting at ſecond hand, if not downe rightly naught and polluting at firſt hand, as ſoone as ever toucht. He that <hi>toucheth pitch</hi> is defiled with it: ſome things are ſo naught as to touch them defiles, to thinke of them, or ſpeake of them: other things may be toucht and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, provided we goe no further, but if hearted; if they come into the ſoule, they vex or bewitch, and ſo will not out againe without becomming ſinne. The Word of Chriſt got into the heart, bids farewell to all joyes fading, to all joyes that will bid the ſoule farewell, that doth not bid them farewell firſt; it makes a joy tranſcending other joyes, and ſo no need of them; and not onely ſo, but a joy ſufficing, ſuch a vaſt being as the ſoule of man is: for the ſoule doth not caſt off old delights, upon the meere excellency of ſome new found out, that ſome of later invention doth ſomething more content; not upon this ground nakedly and ſimply doth the ſoule caſt off old ſinnes, for there are returnes to the ſame filth, unto <hi>mens old ſinnes,</hi> and yet go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foreward to new too, theſe two are conſiſtent in a bad ſtate; the heart doth worſten it ſelfe ſtill as it goes forth to any thing more carnally contenting; and being made worſe, twill at laſt take up its vomit, eate againe an <hi>old ſinne,</hi> by the ſtrength and puniſhment of a new, and ſo hold what he hath, and goe backe and ſinne over former ſinnes againe, with more ſenſleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:113418:227"/>
and with more preſumption than at firſt he did commit them: and the reaſon is, becauſe in old and new delights, he miſſes ſtill ſomething that he aimed at: but the ſoule doth caſt off former delights utterly, upon ſuch a preſent excellency of delight and joy as doth ſuffice and fill up the ſoule: now the Word of God got into the heart, the voice of the Bridegroom heard in the ſoule, or with the ſoule, it makes a full joy, ſuch a joy as beſide or beyond which the ſoule knowes none, nor deſires none.<note place="margin">John 3.29:</note> 
                  <hi>This my joy [therefore] is fulfilled,</hi> ſaid <hi>John: [therefore is fulfilled.]</hi> Wherefore? why that as a friend of the Bridegroome, he could <hi>ſtand and heare the voice of the Bride,</hi> ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually heare Chriſt, eare and heart his words, take in, and take downe the drops that fell from his mouth. Though they are but drops that fall from Chriſts mouth here, in compariſon of what falls from his lips above; yet they are ſo big that they fill the ſoule, every Grape of this Vine <hi>ounce grapes.</hi> There is a grape in forraigne parts, which becauſe of the greatneſſe of it, is call'd an <hi>ounce grape.</hi> Every grape of this Vine, to wit Chriſt, is an ounce grape, every drop from his mouth, an ounce drop, of ſo much juyce and liquor as fills the ſoule with joy; and the ſoule filled once, then it doth indeed bid farewell to all joyes and all delights, parts with all parting things utterly.</p>
               <p>If you finde that the Word is of no ſpirituall force, that it doth not go into your ſoules, Chriſt in this caſe muſt be move'd. Divine inſtitutions are not neceſſarily ſucceſſefull; all meanes are ſo ordered that the ſoule in the midſt of them ſhould looke up to Chriſt. The word and Chriſt, as well as the creatures and Chriſt, are ſeparable here below; though not above, and joyn'd together by faith and prayer. Many brave things may be ſpoken to us from the word, but we can receive in none, unleſſe we have a higher helpe then the meere Word which we heare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There aroſe a queſtion between <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples, and the Jewes about purifying; <hi>John</hi> anſwered the queſtion briefly and pithily, <hi>A man can receive nothing, unleſſe it be [given him from heaven]</hi> meaning not extraordinary graces and gifts for office, nor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary as a Chriſtian, <hi>John</hi> 4.27.

doore, at your eares; but the taking in of theſe into your heart, this muſt be <hi>given you from heaven. And bleſſed him that had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, Heb.</hi> 7.6. 'tis more for a perſon to have the promiſes, then to have meerly the Word preacht to him. <hi>Abraham</hi> was one that had the promiſes, and yet he needed a <hi>ſuper-benediction,</hi> to make all promiſes bleſſings to him, ſomething from heaven, to make all the words he heard on earth, heaven to him; how much more need there a bleſſing from heaven attending men which have not the promiſe as <hi>Abraham</hi> had, but onely the Word ſounded to them? The ſpring is in God ſtill, therefore let no man miſtake himſelfe when he looks upon the Trunke. The Word is but a Pipe, and conveyance of the Spirit: <hi>All my ſtrings are in [thee.]</hi> To have ſprings in our ſoules, to have words turned into works, working words, we muſt with the Spouſe look up to God: <hi>Thou that dwelleſt in the gardens, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions hearken to thy voice [cauſe me to beare it] Cant.</hi> 8.13. 'Tis the complaint of many poore ſoules, that the Word is of no power in them, that it gets within ſuch and ſuch, and they are melted and delated, and run out in ſtrength of love to Chriſt: Why tell your ſad ſtory to Chriſt as the Spouſe doth, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions hearken to thy voice, cauſe me to heare it: ſuch and ſuch can eare and heart the Word, cauſe me to doe ſo too.</p>

The force of reprehenſion drives onely at negative grace; warning catries the ſtrength of prohibition, forbids ſome evill; when this is laid downe, I am not like Chriſt; hee was not onely negatively good, but poſitively; he had no guile in his mouth to be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of; but this was not all; to ſay that his lips were not foule, or were not ſore, will not expreſſe their glory; they were as a thred of Scarlet, as the expreſſion in the <hi>Canticles</hi> is, they had a poſitive glory and beauty, <hi>Grace was powred into his lips, Pſal.</hi> 45.2.

               <p>Finally, this may be aſſured thee, that Chriſt will compleat thy purification ſpeedily, take ſpeed as the Goſpell doth. The heart is deep, nothing in the world like it; things of depth are not emptied nor filled preſently, as men call preſently, but allow Chriſt the liberty of his own Idiome and dialect in ſpeaking, and ſo he is not ſlack, nor long a conſummating the acts of mercy, no he is not long in conſummating the acts of Juſtice, though he be longer ere he accompliſh this then that a great deale. The Lord is not ſlack as men call ſlackneſſe, ſaith <hi>Peter;</hi> and yet hee ſpeaks there about wrath, conſuming wrath; and yet he goes a great deale ſlower about this, being as I may ſay unnaturall to him, then about kindnes and mercy, being things in which he delights.

The rejection of Chriſt is <hi>ſimul tempore,</hi> together in time, with
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:113418:232"/>
the election of ſinne. Sinne is ugly at firſt like an Harlot, but by ſociety and frequenting, beſots, and infatuates, and is more facily drawing then the mans owne wife, although far more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: facility to ſinne, ſpeakes the wards of conſcience broken, the lock of the Cabinet ſpoyled, all the Jewells of the ſoule lying common gifts and abilities the ſervants of ſin at pleaſure, the heart <hi>paſt feeling,</hi> a beaten highway to hell.</p>
               <p>The ſoule is of great price; Chriſt makes this eſtimate from being, we are to make it from property: who and how doth the ſoule love, ſuch is the lovelineſſe of it. <hi>The heart of the wicked is nothing worth ſaith Solomon, Prov.</hi> 10.20. Averſneſſe to Chriſt is any mans wickedneſſe, if the action be the action of the greateſt perſon in the World, 'tis his wickedneſſe; perſons are not reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected with God; actions are impartially lookt upon above, though not below, they are <hi>weighed in a ballance as Job</hi> ſpeakes; nothing ſcand with more exactneſſe then this, how much of Chriſt is in this man and his courſe: if this were but received, the ſoules of ſome of you which heare me this day, would bleed within you; Oh what will become of you wanton Londoners, which have ſo much of Chriſt before you, and ſo little of Chriſt within you, who are quickly any thing but underſtandingly and ſincerely nothing? a Harlot is quickly gained, there needs not much wooing about her; light ſoules make heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: your ſpirituall crummes would be feaſts abroad; you have no minde to that food which thouſands as precious with the Lord Jeſus as you, would bleſſe God highly for: your ſinne makes many miſerable, but your ſelves moſt, though yet you feele it not: ſurely Juſtice hath eſpyed us all carnall, for <hi>Paul, Apollo,</hi> for <hi>Cephas,</hi> for this thing for that, for nothing cordially but our luſt.</p>
               <p>Sinners, can you conſider your ſelves? can you conſider this time? you of this place? your advantages are great, do you know them? it will not be long ere our glaſſe be out, ere we meete be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt; the Sword of Juſtice is at all our breaſts, all that you have heard will be repeated, all that you have rejected will be chronicled with the bloud of your ſoules, to beare witneſſe againſt you, as long as Chriſt and your ſoules are.

A man in Chriſt, that is, a man in the grace and ſtrength of Chriſt, renounceth this, to wit himſelfe, his owne will, which is the ſeat and ſpring of all carnall luſts, and in no other ſtrength whatſoever can he doe it; <hi>My grace is ſufficient.</hi> The old man is bed-ridden, never goes out of his chamber, never out of himſelfe, what ever brave things you diſcerne him doe or ſay; nor can. Perfection here is the through death of ſelfe, <hi>[I] am crucified.</hi> Crucifixion ſpeakes many deaths; head, hands, feet, ſides, breſt, all wounded, nailed; it notes much paine, but through worke; all powers and parts of ſelfe, tortured, crying out <hi>eloy,</hi> much anguiſh and great earth-quakes; but ſelfe at laſt, quite giving up the ghoſt, <hi>[I] am crucified,</hi> the heart blood of all, that may ſpeake me, in any thing that is good, is out; and this through death of ſelfe is wrought with no other engine but Chriſt; that with which ſelfe is crucified, is with Chriſt, <hi>I am crucified [with Chriſt.]</hi> This is the ſtone that ſlaies <hi>Goliah,</hi> that ſinkes into the braine of the Gyant. Our being in Chriſt is the death of ſinne, and the life of grace; as <hi>Jonas</hi> being in the Whale was the death of his pride; this makes perſonall action truly pure, that is of ſuch riſe, and of ſuch reach as fully ſuits the Goſpell, and without which none can be or act. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle gives this bound to ſanctity, if any be ſanctified here, tis in Chriſt, <hi>to them that are ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Sanctification, and glorification is in Chriſt. There is a fulneſſe here, and a fulneſſe hereafter; a perfection of quantity, and a perfection of quality: a perfection of quantity is that which
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:113418:234"/>
Divines call a perfection of parts, as a child hath every finger and every toe, every limbe of a man, though theſe not growne to a mans maturity. Then there is alſo perfection of quality, which Divines call a perfection of degrees, when all parts and gifts are throughly come to maturity; the eye ſo ſtrong, and ſo cleare as able to behold all things that are in God to bleſſe the ſoule; and ſo the eare hearing all things, the tongue taſting all things, the hand feeling all things, that are in and from that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed being, to make the being of the ſoule like it: all this perfection is in Chriſt, and this by the pleaſure of God. <hi>It pleaſed the Father that in him ſhould [all fulneſſe] dwell; grace, glory.</hi> Whatſoever God gives forth here, whatſoever he gives forth above, Chriſt is the continent in which tis laid <hi>With thee is the fountaine of life, and in thy light ſhall we ſee light, Pſal.</hi> 36.9. There are ſtreames and broad rivers which runne to ſoules here; the fountaine of theſe is with him; that is, the whole that God is to man in this world, or will be to man in the world to come, which is explained in that which followes, with thee is the fountaine of life, meaning Chriſt, in thy light we ſhall ſee light. In Chriſt wee have all the bleſſedneſſe that God gives in this world, and in him we ſhall ſee, that is actually poſſeſſe, all that God gives above. Therefore tis that <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>All my ſprings are in thee,</hi> thoſe that runne above; and therefore alſo are the rivers of pleaſure there ſaid to be at <hi>Gods right hand,</hi> the place where Chriſt ſits. In Chriſt wee ſtand and ſee God here in every thing; in Chriſt we ſhall ſtand and ſee God above face to face, that which we cannot doe here and live, no nor there out of Chriſt; <hi>in his light we ſhall be able to maſter that great object,</hi> in his light we ſhall be able to ſee that great light, that dazles all the creation to behold, and then hath the ſoule all that ever it is to have; all that ever it deſires to have. With reſpect to this wide ſcope I am upon, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming concerning Chriſt, <hi>is Christ cald the heire of all things, Heb.</hi> 1.2. Earth, Heaven, grace, and glory. The Apoſtle is yet more expreſſely particular in this thing, and ſaith, that <hi>we are glorified in him. That the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt might he glorified in you, and [ye in him] according to the grace of our God,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.12.

               <p>
                  <pb n="521" facs="tcp:113418:234"/>Perfection is hotly purſued by all, to wit, a compleate ſtate, though what it is and in whom, be miſtaken almoſt by all. The ſoule of man is the greateſt traveller that you have read off; if its travells could be written out, or if any volumne would containe them, you would ſay ſo: as full of motion as there be objects in the world and minutes in the day and in the night, to finde out one fully to bleſſe it ſelfe in, and reſt, but cannot, becauſe Chriſt is overlookt, and therefore dies in travell. Prudence will ſpeak much of this in many experienced perſons, yet Chriſt never the more regarded nor ſought after; this is ſad. Every ciſterne is broken, every veſſell full of leakes, ſaith the ſinner, and yet he is found ſtill ſtopping up theſe leakes, and going out againe to Sea, venturing Life, Soule, Heaven, all that ever is, in theſe broken bottomes: I tremble at no ſtate but this. Conviction abuſed, converſion is farther off the man, then from him that is a ſimple ſinner, that taſts no bitter in any diſh at the Divils table. Folly found out, and yet made further triall of, the man will not, he cannot eſcape puniſhment; if the foole go on, hee will be puniſhed. Firſt-folly is pittied and diſcovered, that is, ſimple ſimplicity, ſimple ſinning as one would ſay, when a man doth thus and thus for want of knowledge: but when the foole is found out, and yet will on, he will now die in his folly. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction is ſanctified, when experienced emptineſſe of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, makes the ſoule looke out where indeed fulneſſe is; when the <hi>Canticles</hi> follow next after <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> when the ſoule with <hi>Solomon,</hi> having found and confeſt the vanity of the creature, falls a breathing and a panting after Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Balaam</hi> was convinced: ſtopt with a drawne ſword from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and yet would on, the Aſſe could not go, and yet <hi>Balaam</hi> would. God Iames and ſlayes things under us, that we ride with our affections like mad men, and yet we have no mind to alight and come off them: things we dote upon, God by ſome ſtroak or other upon them, makes them ſpeake in our conſcience like that Aſſe to <hi>Balaam,</hi> why wilt thou on O my ſoule any further this way? death is before thee, the ſword of Gods diſpleaſure is drawne, and at thy breaſt becauſe of this wicked motion: ſtop ſinner now, ſtop now, caſt thy eye an other way towards Chriſt, and ſee what is in him, taſte how good and gracious he
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:113418:235"/>
is; no I will not, I will have the tother bout, I will ſpurr a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle farther, and ſee to the utmoſt, if I can curſe <hi>Jſrael</hi> and get that great pay proferd. There is a perfection of miſery, as well as of felicity, and this forementioned is it, when a ſinner will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue his ſinne to the utmoſt, go to the end of long ſuffering, then wrath comes inevitably upon him, and to <hi>the utmoſt:</hi> when the man ſay's that his ſinne ſhall out-live every object, ere it ſhall ceaſe, and rides every horſe to death, to fetch and find out plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to keepe his luſt alive, then God ſay's that this luſt ſhall out-live the man too, and then it out-lives all indeed, when the ſoule is rid to death. As there is a never pardoning of ſinne till the ſoule die, ſo there is a never ſubduing of ſinne (for theſe are neceſſarily ſubordinate) till the ſoule die never a taking off the love of ſinne from the ſoule, till the ſoule grow ſicke and die in love.</p>
               <p>All perfection being in Chriſt, tis well onward toward all that neede it, ſuch as are in diſtreſſe for grace, or glory, ſhould ſo account and be incouraged. Sinne is a very burdenſome thing, when God opens the eyes: the aggravations and multiplications of this by conſcience, over-beare the ſoule much. When Chriſt puts not in, how ſhall I withſtand ſo many enemies, get off ſo much pollution; what ſhall I do for this, what ſhall I do for that ſaith the ſoule. Why think on this, all perfection is in Chriſt, and becauſe in him it lies ready for thee. <hi>Every good and perfect gift,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeakes: thou needeſt diſpenſations which have a perfection of goodneſſe in them; Chriſt hath every good and <hi>perfect thing</hi> in him, and becauſe he hath them; they are all ready to be beſtowed on thee, to be beſtowed for nothing: every perfect good he hath is a perfect gift, and <hi>comes downe</hi> ſaith the Text when the ſoule doth not fetch it. Thou haſt many imperfections, and Chriſt hath many perfections, and thou canſt do nothing to get theſe; not one of theſe: if thou couldeſt doe any thing, they would not come this way, for they are al gifts, <hi>perfect gifts, and come downe</hi> upon us, and are not puld downe, as the next verſe doth there interpret, of <hi>his [owne will] hee begat us.</hi> As Chriſt doth begin, ſo he doth finiſh all of his <hi>owne-will.</hi> Chriſt is given, which is, <hi>ſummum</hi> or <hi>perfectum car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinale,</hi> and then every good and perfect thing in him muſt
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:113418:235"/>
needs be ſo too, gifts, and given freely with him as the Apoſtle ſpeakes. <hi>Having given us Chriſt, hee will with him freely give us all things, Rom.</hi> 6.32. 'tis not an eaſy thing to bring the ſoule to belive every perfect good, to be a <hi>perfect gift,</hi> to be as perfectly a gift, as 'tis perfectly good. There is an order in grace, but no merit; firſt this thing is done, then that, but all freely; through this medium and through that, as a Pipe, through Preaching and through Praying, and through Hearing, but not for any of theſe: And therefore when a ſoule objects this, and objects that, he cannot doe this, nor he cannot do that; I will anſwer as many objections of this kind, as any one can poſſibly make; in one word; what ever you need, is <hi>a perfect gift,</hi> I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, nor do no thing to make ſaith, yet there is no cauſe of dejection; faith is a <hi>perfect gift,</hi> more perfectly a gift, then in the formality of the thing perfect: ſo may it be ſaid of all other things, that the ſoule complaines on; grace hath no merit, but order, which is this, when Chriſt would perfect a ſoule in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, he turnes a man off, and out of himſelfe; out of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Gods making, and out of creatures of the mans owne making, out of his prayers and all his duties; and this he doth ſometime, by letting the man fall into ſin, when proud of any parts or workes; and ſometimes in a more mild ſweet way, where nature is more meek and ſweet; and then when the ſoule is turn'd off, and turnd out of all, he that is indeed all, preſents himſelfe to him, and woes and wins the ſoule; I will be a husband to thee, ſaith Chriſt, friends, riches, honours, whatſoever can be deſired to make one bleſſed; the great world is han'gd upon nothing ſo is the little world, to wit, a Chriſtian, brought firſt to be nothing: in underſtanding but a brute; nothing in action but worſe then a brute, a devill, very poore, very poore in ſpirit, and then bleſt with a Kingdom; and now the ſoule that was nothing nor could do nothing for Chriſt or againſt ſin, can do all; having <hi>regnum</hi> he hath <hi>proprium regni;</hi> having a Kingdome, he hath the <hi>proprium</hi> of that Kingdome, which is dominion over all; hee that is made a King and hath a Kingdom, doth not rule in this Town only or that Town, but over all parts in the Kingdom; and this order Chriſt will move in towards you that deſire it; for this Kingdom and all belonging to it, is a perfect gift.</p>

               <p>Coaction with Chriſt is no idle imployment; he doth not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſmall things, neither is he of ſmall ſtrength to keep pace with ſuch weak agents as we are: 'tis hard work to draw in yoke with one that is double and treble in ſtrength above me.

<pb n="525" facs="tcp:113418:236"/>
we are, you may eaſily think our work to be deſperate, full of paine and perill: Had man been ſet to fight with man, one man with one man, that had been painfull worke; but man is drawn out to fight with beaſts, the fierceſt beaſts; with Lions, Beares, Wolves, Serpents, Scorpions, yea, with devills; there was never ſuch a fight in the grand Circue at <hi>Rome.</hi> We <hi>wreſtle</hi> with ſuch creatures as have no hold-faſt to be taken of them, which have no armes, no legs, no fleſh, nor bones; we wreſtle not againſt fleſh and bloud, but againſt principalities, againſt powers, againſt the rulers of the darkneſſe of this world, againſt ſpirituall wickedneſſes in high places, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. We are drawne out to fight upon all the diſadvantage in the world, againſt creatures that are upon higher ground, that have pitched field in high places, that have no fleſh to be wounded, nor bloud to loſe, that can make ambuſhments at pleaſure, being the <hi>rulers of the darkneſſe of this world;</hi> this is the Rhetorick of the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>We are <hi>Stewards of myſteries:</hi> ſentence is paſt upon us to dye ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law which we have broken; onely we have the benefit of our book; but this book is written as books of ſuch nature uſually are, very myſteriouſly, with an old ſtrange Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; our worke is to ſtand by and prompt ſoules concerning their neck verſe, which is very painfull and trembling worke: the book in which ſinners are to read for their life, is written with bloud, which is very inward and ominous inke. The Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and Syllables ſutable, when put together into words, theſe words are ſpirit; <hi>The words I ſpeake,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>are ſpirit.</hi> What is a more inward and hidden thing then this? and yet this are we to interpret; our worke is to be an interpreter betweene two of very remote parts, that live as farre aſunder as heaven and earth, as heaven and hell, I might ſay; between Spirits, the ſpirit of God and the ſpirit of man; one whereof 'tis more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſay, is in hell whilſt out of heaven, then in any middle place between. Tranſactions between God and the ſoule, are the deepeſt, the weightieſt, the intricat'ſt things in the world. A ſinner is convicted, ſentenced, carried to the place of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; his winding ſheet wrapt about his ſhoulders, his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiffe tyed before his eyes, his halter about his neck, his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence written upon his forehead, in this ſhalt thou hang till thou
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:113418:237"/>
bee dead; and yet poſſibly no internall intention concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or meaning the bloud of the ſoule: Divining in this caſe at the foot of the Ladder, what will become of him that is on the top on't ſitting trembling; whether he will be turned off, or fetcht downe with a pardon, is extraordinary hard work to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, and yet beares not upon any extraordinary office; no Angel is diſpatcht from heaven, to be an oracle in this difficult caſe, but it lyes upon our ſhoulders by ordinance. <hi>The Prieſts lips are to preſerve knowledge.</hi> If there be any divining in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary worke, tis not by extraordinary, but ordinary of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; there is not one from the dead to tell who ſhall dye next; no one ſent from hell, to tell who is to come next thither. Things belonging both to the death and life of the ſoule, are made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by our miniſtration, by our labour; wee are the Heralds of Heaven, the Trumpet of God, in which he ſounds Retreat and March, fight and victory, funerall and triumph; we are to ſound ſad and dolefull, ſweet and joyfull; to tell who are ſlaine and who ſaved: our Travells are to all remote parts that are, into Heaven, into hell, into the heart of man where theſe two meet, to ſearch the book of life, and the book of death, to finde whoſe names are written in the one, and to informe the perſons. <hi>Paul</hi> could tell <hi>Clement</hi> and others, that their names were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3. And whoſe names are written in the other, to wit, the book of death; and to informe likewiſe the perſons. <hi>Jude</hi> could tell who were of old ordained to condemnation; we are to ſeek creatures loſt in hel, which is hard work to finde, to ſearch out things hidden in God, from ages and generations, which is harder worke.</p>

                  </label> The ſoule of man certainly is very precious to Chriſt, he ſits up with it late, watches with it very long, burnes out many watch-lights to ſave it if poſſibly from dying eternally. Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be made of things, according to coſt about it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the layer out bee prudent. When you let houſes or lands, this comes in as a conſideration, to heighten rent, what you are out in purchaſe, and repaire. Chriſt cannot be taxt for imprudence or improvidence, and yet he is at more coſt and paines about the ſoule, then about any thing; not onely here and there a man is pickt out, to miniſter to the ſoule, but all
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:113418:237"/>
the creatures in the world, are ſeverally gifted, vertued, decked, and adorned, to miniſter to, and worke upon the ſoule: the words and works of God have all a harmony in this, they all therefore are and abide, which otherwiſe ſhould all paſſe away, were it not to take and gaine the ſoule: there is a juice and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, a ſpirit in every living creature, to incline it to ſerve man, and ſo to by as his ſoule to God. The multitude of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers to the ſoul of man is great; ſome he had at the third hour, ſome at the ſixth, ſome at the ninth; God and the Creation were preaching to man from the beginning; all creatures brought their full goodneſſe to mans full view and uſe, to keep him fully good, but could not: he fell aſleep in the fore-noon, in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, when the primeſt and ſweeteſt ſermons were made, that ever the eares of man heard, and dyed in his ſleep. Wee that come in labourers at the latter part of the day, we preach to the dead; our worke is to fetch the dead to life againe, to raiſe <hi>Lazars</hi> out of their grave, that have lain there long and ſtink; and yet how unſavory ſoever, how impoſſible ſoever our worke is, and ſeemes to be, we muſt upon the perill of the bloud of our own ſoules diſcharge it: our labour is ſpending and ending; we like <hi>Rachel</hi> dye in travell to bring forth ſonnes and daughters to Chriſt: and yet woe to us, we ſhall dye twice, if wee hold not on this labour, and this travell. Certainly Chriſt hath put an high price on poore ſoules.</p>
               <p>I am ſadded to thinke how miſ-judging ſome perſons are of Chriſt and their ſoules: Doth Chriſt milke out his breaſt to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards? ſuch as are baſe borne, and no ſonnes? Can he ſumme up nought, nought? many noughts to a great ſumme, and to a great price? A naughty tongue, a naughty hand, a naughty heart, a naughty conſcience; all theſe naughty parts to a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous whole? I anſwer, Chriſt doth prize naked beings, the ſoule according to its <hi>eſſe,</hi> though it hath never a good quality in it. <hi>What ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoule?</hi> high price is put here upon the ſoule ſimply as it is ſuch a tranſcendent being, beyond others: then againe Chriſt ſets a price upon things according to what he can work them too; he can lay out coſt and paines, mans meate, horſe meat, ſeed and grain, of this kinde, and that; and plow in hope. Perſons of art and skill put a
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:113418:238"/>
price upon this and that graſſe, which others tread under foote as weeds and nothing worth, becauſe by ſuch and ſuch decoctions they know what precious things to bring them to. <hi>Nero</hi> put great price upon <hi>Thapſis a gigantine,</hi> Fennell; his great men about him wondred to ſee him ſend ſo farre for it, and put ſuch eſteeme upon it; but hee did ſo becauſe he knew how to order it with Frankincenſe and other things, to take away the bruiſes of his body. God hath Frankincenſe by him, to wit, Chriſt; and though wee be but as Fennell a weede little worth, yet hee can tell how to order us, and ſhape us, ſo as to bring us to great maturity and price; and according to this, to wit, what he can do with ſoules, doth he put price upon them, though at preſent of little worth: and therefore let empty creatures judge righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerning Chriſt and their ſoules. Would Chriſt be at paines and at coſt to lay pipes to the ciſterne, if he did not meane to fill it?</p>
               <p>Be juſt in opinion concerning Chriſt, and mercifull in practice concerning us, and this is the laſt thing I have to ſay upon the point. Our calling is full of waſting labour, very painefull; eaſen it to us by your plyableneſſe to Chriſt. Sinners are full of ſores, putrified from head to foot, and yet will not be lanced nor dreſt; this is the killing paine of all our paynes, that all we do is rejected: Miniſters would not be gray headed ſo ſoone, nor die ſo faſt, notwithſtanding their great labour, if it were but ſucceſſefull; but this cuts to the heart, and makes us bleed in ſecret, that though we do much, it comes to nothing. I am pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in an Hoſpitall, where there are ſo many ſcore Diſeaſed creatures, that 'twould pity any ones heart to looke upon them, and yet when I come to dreſſe them, they all curſe mee in their heart; and one hides his wounds from mee, an other ſees and ſweares he is as well as I, in as good a condition as his Miniſter, and yet lookes as pale as Death: as black in the mouth, and in the eyes as if he were in Hell already; an other tumbles in blood and filth, and ſayth, this is his Scarlet-ſhute, hee hath no other habit to go brave and gallant in: if he ſhould not do ſo and ſo, he ſhould die in the neaſt, and wiſhes thoſe hang'd that contradict and trouble him: there is ſo many filthy breaths and dampes in the places where wee worke, theſe are the things that kill us
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:113418:238"/>
more then our meere paine; there is ſo much conjuring in the ſpittle where we are placed, and ſo many eyes ſtare and looke ſo fiery and gaſtly, ſo many devils walking among the Tombes and Graves, where we are labouring to rowle away ſtones that lie at the mouthes of them. Theſe are they that teare our Lungs, conſume our Spirits. Our worke dies, therefore we die, not ſo much that we labour, as that we labour in vaine; wee can ſend none out of the Hoſpitall where wee are Phiſitians, upon two Legs, but all upon foure; none goe out well, all die under our hands: all the ſolemnitis belonging to our company, are for the moſt part Funerall ſolemnities, going to the Grave with the dead in treſpaſſes and ſinnes: our invitations are, Sir, mourne with me I beſeech you, for ſuch a one that lies upon his eternall Death-bed, that hath Plague-ſpots in his breaſt, that lies raving, blaſpheming, and much a doe to keepe him in his Bed, to keepe him from leaping into a worſe, (if worſe may be) from leaping deſperatly into Hell. When our Miniſtrey petrefies, turnes hearts into ſtones, and theſe taken up and throwne at us, this kills us: the recoiling of our paines kills us, when our <hi>peace returnes to us,</hi> as Chriſt ſpeakes. <hi>J have laboured in vaine, ſpent my ſtrength for naught,</hi> ſaith the Prophet. When we ſpend our ſtrength to make men more naught then they were, this wounds our heart, which ſhould be conſidered of ſinners; to kill ones ſelfe and ones Miniſter too which would ſave him, what a bloudy condition is this! the bloud of a Miniſter upon a mans ſoule, is more then the blood of many men; ſtubborne ſoules, lay this to heart. When the Poet would cure drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Heathen Emperour, he ſaid, <hi>remember thou drinkeſt the Blood and the Life of the earth,</hi> meaning the juyce of the Grape. So I ſay to you ſtubborne ſinners, remember when you breake the heart of your Miniſters by your ſtubbornneſſe, you deſtroy the Blood and Life of the World. I would I could ſay any thing to breake the Iron ſinnew that is in the neck of ſome ſins and ſinners. Be a friend to us in our worke, and be a friend to your ſelves: come off readily, and ſpeedily to Chriſt, our work will be eaſy and your condition ſafe: hold us fight long, and I know who will fall at laſt with a witneſſe. The warre betweene the houſe of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Saul was long,</hi> ſaith the Text, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.1. the

iſſue was anſwerable: had that malitious ſtubborne man layd downe his Armes, and readily yeilded to the Will of God, to Chriſt that came againſt him in <hi>David,</hi> hee might have found mercy, but he would ſtand it out to the laſt, and weary God and <hi>David</hi> his ſervant, till at laſt there was no remedy, and then all <hi>Davids</hi> Teares, Prayers, and brave ſervices that he had done tooke place and effect with a witneſſe. Make our life dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and Chriſt will make your death dolefull, be as great as you will: ſtay long in the birth and kill Midwife, and you will be delivered in hell: eaſe us and eaſe Chriſt: for Chriſt ſtriveth in us, we ſtrive <hi>but according as be ſtriveth in us;</hi> as ſaith the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing clauſe in my Text, <hi>ſtriving according to his working,</hi> and therefore is <hi>Noahs</hi> ſuffering ſo long, in his paynes for that people, called the <hi>long ſuffering of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2. <hi>London, England,</hi> the blood of many Prophets is upon thee is this nothing? the blood of God is upon thee, and God layes this to heart now: now he makes inquiſition for blood, hee makes blood to touch blood, your blood to touch the blood of them whom you have kil'd in their labour, by your frowardneſſe and wickedneſſe to Chriſt and them.</p>

                  <hi>STriving</hi>] This word ſeconds the explanation given of the former, that the labour of the Miniſtery is very painfull, tis a putting off all powers externall and internall to it, to the utmoſt, tis a <hi>ſtrife, contention, running for a victory, a fight,</hi> ſo the word is in ſeverall places tranſlated. <hi>Fight the good fight of faith. I have fought a good fight:</hi> in both places is the ſame word that here is tranſlated, ſtrive: fighting, running for victory, they are acts wherein the whole man intends it ſelfe, as in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life and death. The worke of our calling is in the former word, generally and ſummarily expreſt, in this word tis parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ſpecified, as it beares upon its particular and proper
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:113418:239"/>
cauſe. When we ſay ſuch a one labours this ſatisfies not; what is his labour? this queſtion is anſwered by this following word in order to our calling. Our labour is in ſome ſence the worſt, the ſowreſt; tis contention, ſpirituall contention, <hi>(i.)</hi> a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which hath its riſe not from our owne ſpirit, but from the ſpirit of God, and its termination in the ſpirit of man. We ſtrive not according to our own will, but according to his Word and Spirit that <hi>ſtriveth and worketh in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contention hath a bad and a good acceptation, the ſpirit lights on fire of Hell ſometimes, and flames out of the mouth and burnes all that ſtand neere, in name, in whatſoever is deare; this is bad contention. Folly lurkes long in an unmortified ſoule, at laſt gets a head, and then words without wiſdome or conſcience toumble out one upon anothers backe, as if they ſhould toumble downe all that is before them, but they throw downe him onely from whom they come. <hi>A fooles lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for ſtrokes;</hi> and in the next verſe, <hi>a fooles mouth is his deſtruction, and his lips are the ſnare of his ſoule, Prov.</hi> 18.6, 7. If ſtanders by can keepe off the flame, this fire burnes no more houſes then into which it comes. The flame that comes out of one mans mouth, if it be not ſuckt in by another, onely one tenement is conſumed; folly is full of humour, humour diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſeth every perſon and action, and apprehends all for ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſo fights againſt, yea ſlayes with the tongue, deare friends for deadly foes, that is, as much as in him lies. Folly generates humour, humour is a baſtard pride; now none ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in any proceedings as the man himſelfe; other folkes children are all untimely births, and miſhapen brats, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all to be murthered with the mouth, and bit to death. Butchery is ſome perſons trade, neighbours children kild; quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and hung out to ſale every day for all that come by, and will buy; pride hardens, the heare hardned, the man will runne againſt any one with his tongue, till he can get other weapons, and ſpot himſelfe all over with the blood of the beſt mans repute in the world, before his face. Contention is a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of a mans off-ſpring before his face, and throwing the blood of them in his face: thou didſt ſay this, and thou didſt doe that Pride hardens, 'tas this property in every ſoule; many
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:113418:240"/>
hearts quard, and become ſulpherous ſtones, the divell takes them up, and ſtrikes fire with them, to burne all. Bad conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath alwaies a diabolicall concurrence more or leſſe; many things may charge and load the Gun, but the Divell gives fire ſtill and makes it off, and helpes to fetch out all that is within the man.</p>
               <p>Contention hath a good acceptation, <hi>good contention is an expliced zeale againſt ſinne.</hi> Sinnes are of ſeverall ſorts, ſome have their tongues cut out of their mouthes by conſcience, and can nor dare ſay nothing of their courſe; others have their tongue in their head, and can and will ſay much for their ſinne, though they die in the place. Parts being conſiderable, ſuch habits are made uſe of, iniquity eſtabliſheth it ſelfe by a law in ſuch a ſoule, what one can make't out to be <hi>de jure,</hi> tis a caſe to be pleaded, and the ſoule will plead in theſe caſes with man, and the man will plead with any man, that his ſoule may hold its owne, and ſin keepe warme where tis: parts and parties are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now drawn out, and <hi>ſtrong reaſons</hi> brought forth; <hi>produce your ſtrong reaſons,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Eſay</hi> 41.21. Productions of this kinde, made abortives by truth, truth in ſtrength drawn out againſt that which is falſe, enervating and ſilencing ſinfull diſputes and practices, is good contention. Thus did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> contend, <hi>Then contended I with the Rulers and ſayd, why is the houſe of God forſaken? what evill thing is this that ye doe? did not our fathers thus?</hi> and brought all this evill upon them? <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13. Man muſt not move as a beaſt which knowes not the ground he goes upon: action muſt have authority, and the production of this authority is ſometimes neceſſary; if this or that be not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid by rule, 'tis to be condemnd by the rule; and this is every ones priviledge, that hath ability and opportunity, by vertue of a generall or a particular call; by vertue of a generall call as a Chriſtian, to reſiſt ſinne, and errour, which is a publique enemy and traytor to the State which any one may lay hands on; and therefore tis that <hi>Jude</hi> exhorted the Chriſtians to put hand to this worke, as well as himſelfe: when hee wrote to them of a common ſalvation, he wrote unto them alſo about a <hi>common enemy,</hi> and told them that they ought to contribute ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch as well as he; <hi>twas needfull for me to write unto you,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:113418:240"/>
and to exhort you that [ye] ſhould earneſtly contend for the faith.</hi> You may thinke (as if he had ſaid) that it is my worke onely, to contend for the faith, and againſt that which oppoſeth it, but it is ſo mine, that it is alſo yours by a generall calling; perſons by the advantage of a particular calling, draw a greater force into the field againſt the common enemy, but others are bound to contribute what they have to this worke, as well as they. Wee are as men deſigned, and advantaged peculiarly, as Generals to lead in this ſad worke, to which the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 15.10. <hi>Woe is me my mother, that thou haſt borne me a man of ſtrife. Jeremiah</hi> had a particular call from the wombe, to live as a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamander in the fire all his daies; theſe as gifted and wealthy perſons, raiſe more force, and bring a greater ſtrength into the the field then others can, but the worke beares upon all; The Apoſtle intimates it, in that hee ſpeakes as putting into this worke onely as one, <hi>whereunto I alſo labour,</hi> and ſtriving accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his working in me.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> My purpoſe is to be preciſe in this point, and to purſue onely the divine nature of contention, which lies in two things, a holy riſe, and a holy ſcope. Many bad things boyle in an evill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, theſe now and then boyle over, and ſcald ſtanders by, in ſomething that is worthy: bitter language may come from a ſweet ſpirit, but then the perſon is in a temptation, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt ſinne ſinfull and ſucceſſeſſe, in order to what might be ſimply meant: at firſt ſetting out oppoſition externall which ſprings from any ſuch bad principle internall, ſtaines the nature of the act quite through; there is a warre from ones luſt, as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith; the ſpirit within diſſents ſome perſon with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and therefore ſpits in his face, when it ſpeakes to him, that every one may know him, and have as low an eſteeme of him as he hath. Affection prejudiced, in order to the perſon I deale with, and ſo oppoſition the fruit of an ill diſpoſition, this is impure contention. Fire of this nature is heavenly, when it ſprings from love to the man, and hatred to his ſinne: ſinne is ſuch an ugly thing, that it becomes no body, no not a friend; tis a blacke ſpot, but not a beauty ſpot in any ones face; ſet it where you will, cut it how you will; when love moulds words to diſcover ſo much to the face of him that thinkes otherwiſe;
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:113418:241"/>
I would not have any one that I love, live or die in any thing that Chriſt hates: This is Divine contention, precious balme.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Divine contention hath a divine riſe, a divine ſcope, which is to convince, and to convert; truth is lovely in the eye, as well as in the practice; yet hath many gainſayers in both; theſe muſt be replied to, till they have nothing to ſay to any purpoſe; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of waight are a conſiderable ſpirituall army, and ought to be encountered, though fooles muſt not be anſwered in their folly. There is gainſaying with tongue or conſcience; diſpute muſt be ſo ſteeld with truth, till one or both be ſilenced; the Scriptures are ſufficient this way, they are given by inſpiration, and profitable for <hi>doctrine,</hi> for <hi>reproofe,</hi> for <hi>conviction,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. Weapons drawne out of the word, and ſo skilfully and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently uſed, till pride be ſtabd, and conſcience ſpeechleſſe, and breathing out its laſt for the evill courſe it walkt in; this is handling the Word of God, and the ſoule of man, <hi>not deceitfully,</hi> but really, and is holy ſtrife; deckes ſet a fire not to burne the ſhip, but to blow up them at top that would take the whole veſſell.</p>
               <p>Contention is not onely to ſtop, but to turne a ſinner; tis a travell, and pangs ceaſe not till ſatan be ruind, and Chriſt formd. Conviction and converſion are two things; a man may feele the evill of his owne way, and yet taſte no ſweet in Chriſts; vomiting is painfull, the ſtomacke takes great diſlike and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence at what it opened its mouth greedily to take in; one would thinke in this caſe twere impoſſible that what is ſo violently thrown out, ſhould ever be ſavoured, and taken in againe; yet not in this caſe, (therefore in no caſe with ſome creatures) is there an abhorring for ever. Dogs will returne to their vomit, and ſinners, but ſhadowed in that metaphor: ſpirituall ſtrife is to make certaine the ſtate of a Chriſtian; yea, to give the ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate or utmoſt of this ſtate; to make former vomitings, <hi>old ſinnes,</hi> yea, old graces <hi>(i.)</hi> graces in ſuch and ſuch a degree, to be forgotten; to put forward, and to <hi>preſent every one perfect,</hi> in parts, perfect in degrees, which is the emphaſis and connexion of the frontice terme of the Text, <hi>That wee may preſent every man perfect in Chriſt [whereunto] I labour and ſtrive.</hi> Holy ſtrife tends
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:113418:241"/>
to bring perſons to perfection, it is fighting a <hi>good fight;</hi> the iſſue of which is, the ſoule able to lay <hi>hold of eternall life;</hi> able to let go hold of ſin, of any ſin, and to take hold of any grace; of all grace, of <hi>eternall life.</hi> Running of this kind is in its ſcope as others, to <hi>obtaine,</hi> (i.) the glory of God and ſalvation of the ſoule; our fight of this kind, is not onely to kill, but to make alive; to make an eternall death and an eternall life; to make an eternall death to ſin, and an eternall life to Chriſt.</p>

                  </label> Strife is common now, all the world is on fire; but tis ſo voyd of divine property, that I know not what will become of us all; tis hell fire that burnes onely to torment perſons, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſinnes; ſuch is our lung and tongue conteſts at this day; as for other fights (the Lord be gracious to us) they are very bloody, but what their nature is otherwiſe, I am unskild to ſpeake: heart fight makes hand fight; love was ſlaine before our wars began, or we had never gone together by the eares with any weapon, neither with tongue nor hand. Juſtice hath found us out, and turnd our inſide outwards; what will be in the end God knowes; if the Spirit of Chriſt be wanting in contention, tis the ſaddeſt worke in the world, and of the moſt deſperate iſſue, and yet nothing puts upon greater temptation this way. When a houſe is a fire a little winde will make the blaze very big, big enough to conſume all; when <hi>David</hi> had his Sword by his ſide, how quickly was he over-heated by a foole? tis ſo in ſpirituall conteſts, when friends meet to argue, they are as ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers with their weapons by their ſides; one foole now in the company, a little folly throwne out over-heats and fires all of a ſudden, and ſets all together by the eares, if Chriſt be not very gracious. Selfe muſt be firſt ſlaine in me, before I goe to deſtroy any part of ſelfe in another; otherwiſe I ſhall wound mine owne ſoule, when I goe to cure anothers; vain-glory is conceited, ſuch a man is a reformer of all but one; this exactneſſe, becauſe it cannot accompliſh it ſelfe, turnes into frowardneſſe; and now he that cannot mend all will marre all; <hi>the froward ſoule ſowes ſtrife,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 16.28. Theſe are the moſt dangerous perſons of all: there is a ſtrife of words, and a ſtrife of matter; reaſon, not paſſion, muſt onely fight againſt folly; this makes conqueſt and honour; ſtrength and vigour of matter, not vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:113418:242"/>
and virulency of words and luſt; in this latter ſtrife wee can doe nothing that is honourable to our ſelves, or benificiall to others; and therefore its a ſtrife utterly forbidden by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrife or vain-glory, but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Yet let not what is honourable be condemnd with that which is diſhonourable. I am to ſtrive with any to plucke a brand out of the fire; men come not out of the armes of a harlot with eaſe; tis not divine ſtrife, but diabolicall that is our plague at this day, and this in no mans heart more, then in theirs that cry-out moſt of the diviſions of the Land, ſects, ſchiſmes, and factions. I have not a word to ſay for any one that walkes beſides rule. That ſtrife in ſacred things, which ſtrikes at mens honours, liberties, and the like, is fire not from above, but from below, and will keepe perſons and Kingdoms low; the ſword will never be turnd into a plowſheare, nor want worke in the world, while this ſpirit lives. Our weapons in divine things are ſpirituall; if we make them carnall, we ſhall abuſe inſtitution, and attempt to kill the King of the Jewes in the Cradle, to keepe our ſelves King; truth ſhall no ſooner bud, but have its braines knockt out with a club; which hath been the effectuall argument of Antichriſt, theſe many hundred yeeres; and the argument of Epiſcopacy now on foot in the field, which hath coſt a great deale of blood to anſwer; and yet we are neceſſitated to anſwer, as we are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; which ſhould make us and poſterity for ever after us, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor ſuch kind of ſtrivings, to advance the things that we thinke Chriſts.</p>

               <p>DIvine action according to its firſt cauſe, is here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: Firſt Chriſt workes, and then a Chriſtian. Chriſt is the <hi>Prince of life;</hi> ye have denied the holy one, and killed the Prince of life, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.15. That is the prime and firſt maker and breather of life: as Chriſt is the Prince of life, ſo he is the Prince of all the acts of life; that is, <hi>the preparations of the heart in man,</hi> as well as the anſwer of the tongue, are from the Lord. Ere divine actions are attempted, there are great thoughts of heart in a good man. How ſhall I move in this action congruous to the will of Chriſt? a Chriſtian travels ſtill to bring forth; now theſe travellings of the ſoule, as well as the birth it ſelf, are all from Chriſt; the training and exercizing of armes, as well as the fight and conqueſt. He workes <hi>the will and the deed</hi> of his good pleaſure. There is a firſt mover in order to the whole, and a firſt mover in order to the parts: the will is the firſt mover in order to the parts; not an organ or faculty ſtirres, not a thought workes or ſits up a moment, with any content about any thing, till firſt the will will it: this firſt mover is not inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, not the originall of its owne influence upon other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: the firſt mover in order to the whole, moves the will, which is Chriſt; he gives the very deſires and inclinations of the heart to things that are heavenly; <hi>according to his working, wee ſtir and work,</hi> the expreſſion meanes this, that what we are as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians intentionally or actually, in thought, word, or deed, we are wholly of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Three words will compriſe all that belongs to a Chriſtian, though three thouſand words will not expreſſe it, <hi>efficiency, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency, al-ſufficiency,</hi> and all theſe are of Chriſt. The firſt term compriſes the very being of a Chriſtian, <hi>eſse Chriſtianum:</hi> A Chriſtian preciſely ſo conſidered, that is, as divine life and ſoule is together, as one would ſay, and he is as <hi>Melchiſedeske</hi> without father and mother, without any propagator in all the world
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:113418:243"/>
but Chriſt: there is much variety of things in the world, and yet all of very knowne and very low birth; ſome are borne <hi>of bloud,</hi> that is, of very corruption, of very filth and excrement, which we call a praeternaturall Generation; others are borne of the <hi>will of the fleſh;</hi> that is, of a naturall Generation; others of the <hi>will of man,</hi> that is an artificiall Generation, as all your ſtructures of art and ingenuity, which are the birth of mens braines: but a Chriſtian is none of theſe births, he came none of theſe wayes into this World, <hi>hee is of God; which were borne not of bloud nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God,</hi> 1 <hi>John,</hi> which is explained in the verſes foregoing and applied to God-man, to wit Chriſt, <hi>to as many as received him,</hi> meaning believers, <hi>to them gave [hee] power to be called the Sonnes of God.</hi> The reception of Chriſt makes the conception of a Chriſtian; as ſoone as the Babe ſtirres in the wombe, as ſoone as love-thoughts begin to leape in the ſoule, towards Chriſt and the things of Heaven, that very quickning is from the power of Chriſt. The <hi>Sonne hath power to quicken whom he will, and none elſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The power of Chriſt doth make life, and makes this life more abundant, that is, ſtrong enough to ſhew it ſelfe in every action as ſuch a life, as ſuch a noble-natured thing. Not onely our efficiency but our ſufficency is of Chriſt. The being of grace and the lively actions of grace, ſuch a potent and vigorous being. 'Tis common to miſtake ſpeciall things: a Chriſtian man is a likely man to act Chriſtianly, therefore an able man, 'twill not follow: for life and ſtrength, are two things: a creature may have a ſpecificall life, proper enough to ſuch a noble buſineſſe, and yet not be able to doe it. As ſome workes and actions are proper to a rationall Life, to a creature indowed with reaſon, and yet ſuch a creature not able to do ſuch workes, becauſe not indowed with reaſon enough: 'tas <hi>efficiency</hi> but not <hi>ſufficiency,</hi> 'tas not the maturity of its being, the complement of its kind. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of himſelfe as a Chriſtian, and in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſtians, yea, and ſpeaking all this as under great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, yet diſclaimes a ſufficiency as ſuch a perſon, to act like himſelfe; as a good man, to thinke a good thought; or as a good gifted man, to preach a good Sermon; <hi>not that [wee] are
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:113418:243"/>
ſufficient of our ſelves to thinke any thing as of our ſelves, but [our ſufficiency] is of God which makes us able Miniſters of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. ſufficiency hath its birth from God as well as efficiency; one degree of grace, doth not forme another, but every degree form'd by Chriſt. There is the grace of being, and the grace of ſtrengthning: the ſufficiency of a Chriſtian to act as ſuch a noble perſon, beares upon the latter. <hi>I can doe all things through Chriſt that [ſtrengthens mee]</hi> hee doth not ſay through Chriſt that hath given mee life, but through Chriſt that gives concurrence and ſufficiency to this life, in order to all that is to be performed by it. The word <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> which the Apoſtle uſeth in the place before mentioned, is rendered by a very fit word <gap reason="foreign">

man ſpiritually, <hi>rich in Faith,</hi> rich in Hope, rich in Love; abounding in this gift, in that gift, in every gift, That ſpeaks Chriſtianity: if there bee any ſuch, al-ſufficient man, <hi>'tis of Chriſt, being inriched [in every thing] to all bountifulneſſe] which cauſeth through us thanksgiving to God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11. if there be any generall rich man, <hi>inriched to every thing,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, hee tells us to whom it muſt bee acknowledged; to God.</p>
               <p>All good is of Chriſt; habit, act; nothing is of us, <hi>in me dwells no good;</hi> no mans ſtate is hopefull till this principle be well ſetled in the ſoule. Mortall Diſeaſes makes ſometimes but little ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome: 'tis ſo frequently concerning the ſoule; Pride is a mortall malady, a ſoule that complements with Chriſt, about his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall condition, wants are ſo few in number, and ſo ſmall of conſequence; the ſymptome of this is a ſenſleſſe ſpirit at the Throne of grace: God hath many a lie told to his face. <hi>God I thanke thee I am not as ſuch and ſuch, J am in a very hopefull ſtate over many are, for I doe this and that.</hi> There is a ſtroaking of ſelfe in and after ſome performances: ſometimes God is told of it, but often man: 'tis an implicite contradiction of the point in hand, all is not of Chriſt, ſomething is of the man himſelfe: hee obſerves his crawlings in Divine things, and they are very glorious in his eye, but doth not obſerve the Toade in his belly that he crawles with, to wit, <hi>ſelfe.</hi> Selfe-action hath this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, a man is much taken with his own motion; ſome Artiſts will pride themſelves much in a peice they draw themſelves, and will plead for it much, though there be little Art or Worke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip in it in compariſon of that which ſome others draw. Swallowes catch vermin as they flee: when they flee high, 'tis after Flies: when they flee low, 'tis after Flies: they live upon the vermine of their motion, and keepe their wings ſo long and ſo ſtrong, with the imperfect animall they flee after. Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this property is common, but I like it not: the mans Religion is ſometimes of a higher and nobler, ſometimes of a meaner and lower ſtraine, as will beſt correſpond obſervers but ſtill in its ſcope, one, to catch Flies, to live upon ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect thing that is met with in the motion; and when no Flies can be catcht, neither by flying high, nor flying low, no car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:113418:244"/>
incouragement, then keepe the neaſt, the houſe, and do nothing. Chriſtians that live upon the vermin of their moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are up and downe, high and low, very uncertaine in ſanctity and conſolation, and this may characteriſe every man to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that is not practically cleare in this point, that habit and act are both of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>By-things lookt at, cannot bring in nor beare up, ſuch a noble life as we pretend to when we profeſſe a religious life; this life is according to every dram drawne from Chriſt, 'tis not from the ſpeciouſneſſe of our owne action, nor from other folkes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement. This time is full of ſtraits, externall ingagements byaſſe men much, about internall and externall things; if this temptation were over ſaith one, I would take a better courſe. No thou wouldſt not: courage to the things that are noble, ſprings not from any earthly advantage; if all ſecular authority in the Land, ſhould ſay, they would ſecure thee, for any dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage that thou ſhouldeſt ſuffer, in purſuite of ſuch a Religious cauſe, yet would thine owne heart fall off like the <hi>Jſraelites</hi> from entring the holy Land, and thou wouldeſt as they, ſtep back, when at the doore ready to enter, who though <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> bid them to enter, yet they fell off: ſo though Parliament and Synod were at thy back, and did incourage thee to enter, yet if thou have no other incouragement, thou wilt not ſtep a ſtep in the wayes of God; <hi>by the grace of God J am that J am,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul;</hi> let all the men in the World be never ſo gratious to thee, yet wilt thou be as ungratious as thou art, to the day of thy death, if the grace of Chriſt do not put Spirit and Life into thee.</p>
               <p>Externall inducement is nothing; that mans Religion is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that thinks otherwiſe, and 'twill prove ſo to his ſhame and loſſe, if his eyes be not opened to ſee it. If a man ſpeake meerly of a naturall life, that is, a life as a man, as ſuch a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then a man may ſay of externall good things, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> of health and ſtrength, and other outward advantages, <hi>in theſe is the life of my ſpirit:</hi> but if you ſpeake of Divine Life, life to that which is Heavenly; in riches, honours, friends, parts, in no exernall thing, in no internall thing, but in Chriſt, is the life of my ſpirit; <hi>according to his working,</hi> not according to my own
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:113418:245"/>
working, ſhall I worke for God, and for his glory. Stratagents and wiles, is much made uſe of in theſe times of woe; Satan uſes it too: ſtay ſaith hee, till Parliament and Synod put life into thee, till they doe this, and they do that, ('tis good to honour authority, in that which is proper to ſuch authority) but ſo you may ſtay till the ſword of Gods wrath that is in the Land kill you all. Worke <hi>according to his working</hi> within you, and take heed of checking this, to waite for others working without you, to ſet you forward; ſtrangle the quicknings of the ſpirit, and expect quicknings from men, and thou wilt be executed by conſcience for the greateſt murtherer in the World.</p>
               <p>Our life beares upon the operation of Chriſt. Lets make Chriſt the fountaine, and then lets draw as much water of life from him as may bee. You ſee how exact and expreſſe the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion is made, betweene Chriſts operation and our life; ſuch operation; ſuch life; we ſtrive according to his working: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lets ſet Chriſt at worke hard, and get as much divine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration and life from him as may be. Divine operation is the choyſeſt mercy in the World; how full of life is my ſpirit when in the Hands of God! when hee hath it working and moulding of it! commend thy ſpirit therefore often into his hands, ſend him much worke. Spirits are ſo much imployed and over-wrought in the World, that Chriſt hath little or no work ſent him, no houſe nor ſhop to work in. A man? no: an image ſtands before God in duty, a thing without a ſoule; no ſpirit ſent to God to talk with: no ſoule, no child of the ſoul at home, to tell where the Parent is: children of the ſoule, I meane thoughts &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, all ſacrificed to devills, at the end of the earth; and thus farre from home muſt abide, and never be ſent for home, who ere come to viſit them, though it be Chriſt himſelf: what Divine operation can be in the ſoule, when the ſoule is ſo given up to gadd after worldy things? Divine operation is a very retired act two great Pears in conference &amp; may not be interrupted (things in diſcuſſe, being of ſuch great concernment,) the Spirit of God and the ſpirit of man. Divine operation, it is a viſion from Heaven; of property like that of <hi>Pauls,</hi> that bindes the ſoule in order to all carnall objects that may make the minde gad; and in this viſion as in that is a voyce, a ſtill voyce, <hi>Saul, Saul,</hi> ſinner, ſinner
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:113418:245"/>
why doſt thou do this and that againſt me? but this ſtill voyce, is full of life to the ſoule that ſtilly liſtens, this operation of Chriſt ſilenceth that noyſe which is in the ſoule, by the operation of other things, and then is there a voyce from Heaven to the ſoule, <hi>come up hither O ſoule,</hi> thou muſt be above this and that, for the tranquillity and felicity of thy life. Theſe are the operations of God, in which is the life and Heaven of man. All divine operation hath voyce, the word and the ſpirit goe together ſtill, Chriſt workes and talkes, makes peace and <hi>ſpeakes peace,</hi> makes war, and ſpeakes it to conſcience. You might know what God is a working in your ſoules, hee ſpeakes it now and then very plaine to conſcience: you that have eares to heare what the ſpirit ſaith; the ſpirit workes, and then it ſpeakes what it workes; the ſpirit <hi>[ſaith]</hi> now and then in ſtill weather, if you liſten now and then you may heare what it <hi>ſaith.</hi> The ſpirit and the word go together, one moves and quickens the ſoule by the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Hell-ward or Heaven-ward; the one ſhould be much dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the other much deſired; Divine operation is a thing of the greateſt concernment in the World, 'tis as the ſpirits in the blood; if the Pulſe beate and worke not, ſpirits are all waſted, death is ſeized upon the ſtate. Sinners, I know not how God workes in your ſoules, how hee hath ſtirred, or how he doth: onely know this, when he leaves <hi>pulſation,</hi> that is, ceaſeth knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, know that your life is departed: the operation and the pulſation of God, is the life of the ſoule; the life of the ſoules, is the bleſſedneſſe of the ſoule; as I am lively and agile in divine things, carried upon Eagles wings to God in all duties, ſo am I in Heaven. Get as much therefore of this operation and life, as you can. I ſpeake this, becauſe there is a great difference in Divine operation. There is an operation that makes <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>In-operation ſimply conſidered, is a ſupreme act, making an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall impreſſe upon the ſoule, for life or death.</hi> Things have their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by poſition; ſo they may be put that every one cannot reach them nor finde them out; the heart hath this advantage, tis a hidden man, an inward creature. What you looke upon or touch, when you have to doe with a creature of your owne making, is fleſh and bones; but the manhood of this ſubſtance, or that which makes this ſubſtance a man, is hidden within; ſo hid that none can reach, but by ſupreme power of its owne, or borrowed. <hi>Among theſe Nations ſhalt thou have no eaſe, but the Lord ſhall give thee there a trembling heart, and ſorrow of mind, Deut.</hi> 28.56. <hi>The Lord ſhall give thee there a trembling heart:</hi> a ſtone may be ſtirred and toumbled ſometimes, when it is not broken: Conſider the heart under this metaphor, as the Scripture doth, for ſome refractory properties of it, and this ſtone that lies at the center of the little world, cannot be ſtirred, nor the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this little world ſhaken in the leaſt but by a ſupreme power; <hi>The Lord ſhall give thee there a trembling heart.</hi> Thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall operations which make a wicked mans heart ſhake and tremble ſometimes, they are from the Lord, and when the Lord takes off his hand, the ſtone lies ſtill againe; lift and pull whoſo will, as long and as much as hee will, the ſinner ſtirres not;
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:113418:246"/>
which is authority enough, that internall operation is a ſupream act. If this be not, <hi>Job</hi> gives further authority, and makes a higher inſtance. Conſider the ſtone that lies at the center of the earth, the foundation ſtone of the little world, I meane the heart, as ſhaken, or as broken, and God doth it; <hi>God maketh my heart ſoft, and the Almighty troubleth me, Job</hi> 23.16. When a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans heart melts and is diſſolved; take it in a refreſhing ſenſe, or take it in an afflicting ſenſe, ſupreame power doth it: man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe this himſelfe; a ſinner, a Saint, cannot move the ſtone in his boſome one jot; tis an Almighty act that reacheth the heart of any man; <hi>the Almighty ſtirs me within.</hi> Internall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is as I have ſaid, a <hi>ſupreame act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This act makes <hi>eternall impreſſe:</hi> Internall operation, is from a high hand, and of high concernment; tis of everlaſting force: the Spirit is called an eternall Spirit, not ſo much in order to being, as in order to operation; the things that this Spirit worketh in us and for us, are life eternall: the workman, the workhouſe, the worke wrought in this houſe, are all eternall: the Spirit eternall, the ſoule eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, the workes wrought here, the carvings or cuttings, are eternall; unalterable; if Chriſt make but the leaſt dint upon the heart, I may challenge all powers in heaven and in earth to even it. Operations externall are not eternall; not a worke you looke upon without, though never ſo great or glorious, but fades, and ſhall be turnd into its fitſt nothing; but operations internall are eternall; what God doth in the ſoule, is to laſt as the ſoule; if he drop mercy into us, this drop ſhall laſt for ever, though all the mercies without us may be gone in a moment: if he drop juſtice and wrath into us, this drop abideth for ever. God is called immutable, not ſo much in order to being, as in order to action; and not in order to all action neither; but in order to internall actions; ſuch as are done about the ſoule. <hi>I am God immutable and change not;</hi> Change not? in what? in <hi>eſſe?</hi> that is granted of all, and needs no affirmation; no, this is not the thing; but in <hi>operari:</hi> and about this many doubt. I have drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mercy into the hearts of the ſonnes of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and it ſhall never out; I have begun a good worke, a good internall worke, and it ſhall laſt to the day of Chriſt; it ſhall laſt unto Heaven, that
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:113418:247"/>
is for ever; therefore is the Spirit, according to his preſence and internall operation, called the earneſt of Heaven, and the ſcale to the day of redemption; it makes impreſſe upon the ſoule ſo deepe, that abides for ever; the worke the Spirit doth in us, outſtands the gates of hell; the Temple that Chriſt now builds in us, not a ſtone, not the leaſt pin of it, moulders to all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, tis ſo wrought: tis ſo on the other hand, what he doth internally in poynt of juſtice, he doth it to purpoſe. All the world on fire without, you may ſooner quench it, then one ſparkle of the fire of Gods wrath, which he caſts <hi>into a man;</hi> this is an everlaſting fire, an <hi>alway puniſhment,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks; <hi>Bow downe their backe alwaies,</hi> pointing at <hi>Doeg</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſuch like wretches, that were internally puniſht. A man inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſmitten by the juſtice of God, his backe is broke for ever: take <hi>Job</hi> but as hee perſonates a wicked mans caſe; forbeare the application of it to himſelfe, as he doth, being then in a temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; let his perſon alone, but take the thing, as his apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is opened fully in this poynt, to his triall for a time, and you ſhall have him ſpeake notably, of the property of internall operation, in order to evill men. <hi>God is in one mind,</hi> when he is at worke in wicked ſoules, <hi>one cannot turne him; what his ſoule deſireth that he doth, Job</hi> 23.13. If after great provocation, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings and ſtrivings without, by words and blowes, hee goe to worke within, to fit the veſſell for wrath; if this be now the will of God, there is no turning of him, nor no turning of the point, nor edge of the tooles hee workes with; no terminating the effect ſhort of the Authors intention: the Trinity in their action internall, to expreſſe this property of it are called <hi>agents hitherto. The Father worketh hitherto, and I worke;</hi> obſerve about what works Chriſt was, when he ſpake thus; he was about internall action, to wit, the curing of the cripple which had laine ſo long at the poole; which was a cripled ſoule, as well as a cripled body.</p>
               <p>Internall operation is of eternall force; this is generall and indetermined: therefore it followes in the definition, tis of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall force to ſuch an expreſſe end, <hi>to life and death:</hi> that which Chriſt doth within about the heart, is vitall or mortall, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the creature for his furtheſt end. To make miſerable or bleſſed here, is not the furtheſt end of internall operation, though
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:113418:247"/>
the furtheſt end of externall operation. Externall donations which are the workes of Gods hand, their furtheſt end is to make a ſweet condition here; as riches, and the like, they will availe here. <hi>Money anſwers all;</hi> but they will not availe any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then here, for the felicitating of man; they will not availe in death, much leſſe in judgement, to doe man any ſervice: but the furtheſt end of internall operation, is to make curſed or bleſſed in death, and after death in another world, when and where nothing elſe can. There be gifts that be meere Spirit, which have not a jot of any carnall thing in them; theſe we call internall; theſe are moulded ſome by juſtice, ſome by mercy, and you ſhall ſee what their end is, by an inſtance or two. <hi>God hath given them a ſpirit of ſlumber, Rom.</hi> 11.8. Here hee ſpeakes of operations all ſpirit; <hi>God hath given them a ſpiris of ſlumber;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall workes, and the Prophet tels the end and iſſue of theſe; tis deciſive, to diſpatch them; they have a ſpirit of ſlumber, that they may goe away in a ſlumber; <hi>Shut their eyes, lest they ſhould ſee with them; ſtop their eares leſt they ſhould heare with them,</hi> and convert, and be healed. Internall operation wee ſee diſpatches the ſoule one way or other. <hi>Into whatſoever houſe ye enter ſay peace, and if that would not take, ſpeak death:</hi> Theſe were but emblems of Chriſts internall action. <hi>Into what houſe</hi> or heart Chriſt goes to worke, by his Word and Spirit, hee makes through worke; the Axe is then to the root; it makes exciſion or circumciſion at leaſt. All internall operation is to cut off ſinne off the ſoule. <hi>He is a Jew that is one inwardly; Circumciſion is that of the heart:</hi> When he goes to worke inwardly, he doth exciſe or circumciſe, and thus I have opened the nature of internall operation.</p>
               <p>The worſt evill is curable, the greateſt good attainable; this iſſues naturally from this point, that there is ſuch an engine to be found, that can worke inwardly. Our greateſt maladies are thoſe that are within; that one plague that was upon <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, (to wit) the hardning of it, was more then the ten plagues upon his outward man. Evils are not rightly weighed; this is one of the greateſt evils: they which ſtrip us moſt of externall things, they are accounted greateſt: no, they are not; that which gnawes upon the ſoule after outward things are gone, is greater. There is death, and <hi>the bitterneſſe of death,</hi> as <hi>Agag</hi> ſaid; the one it
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:113418:248"/>
is a greater evill then the other by farre. The death of husband, wife, child, or the death of eſtate, is nothing, if it be but a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked departure of theſe, if their ghoſt doe not walke afterwards in the ſoule, if there be not after their departure a bitter tang in conſcience, as evilly got or as evilly kept; got with too little conſcience, and kept with too much affection; the cup of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, fill it as full as the world, or as ſatan can, if God doe not put one Ingredient in it or other, to make it off with a tang and a touch upon the ſpirit, tis nothing: when a malady doth feſter inwardly, and lights of ſome blood-veſſels that carries it more directly to the heart, then it is a malady indeed; and yet in theſe caſes there is hope, if taken in time, becauſe there are things inwardly vertuall and operative: ſo we can ſay ſpiritually; the ſtrongeſt poyſon that the ſoule hath taken in, cannot render the condition deſperate, becauſe there are things of an internall vertue; operations that can reach the ſoule: Chriſt can purge the inward man, and can let the inward man blood; with his Word he can pricke the heart, any tumor or ſwelling in it, and let out all the watery or fiery matter that is in it; he can wound the ſpirit and then heale it; make clouds, and then expell them; make darkneſſe upon the face of the deepe, upon the ſoule that deepe part of man, and then make a Sunne riſe in this hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, in that more then halfe the little world that lies out of fight: when more then halfe the little world is drowned, when that in part of man is quite overwhelmed: yet then is not the caſe deſperate; nor ſhould any ſoule give it up as ſo. Miſery ſometimes ariſes to extremity; extremity is darkneſſe without any light; a whole Army engaged and routed; <hi>without fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, within feares:</hi> the hand can doe no more, the head doe no more; all faculties have pumpt themſelves dead in the place: I cannot thinke a thought to refreſh me; the waters are come in to my ſoule, and come in ſo deepe, that I give up my ſelfe for loſt. This poore ſoule hath more ſorrow then is godly. Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is unkind, when it oppreſſes; oppreſſion is not alwaies from another; I may be an oppreſſor to my ſelfe; and this is when I write death upon my perſon, becauſe Chriſt hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten death upon all my actions. Wher thou canſt doe no more, wilt thou give up thy ſoule for loſt? if this ſhould be generally
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:113418:248"/>
practiſed, there would not a ſoule be ſaved. Waters are come into thy ſoule, and thy heart is overwhelmed; and yet in this deepe internall diſtreſſe, a Rocke may be found, ſomething higher then thee may appeare for reliefe, by a ſupreame hand. <hi>From the ends of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed; lead mee to the Rocke that is higher then I, Pſalm</hi> 61.2. When the water is got in to me, and overwhelmes my heart, yet then there is one higher, and taller then I, that can pull mee out of theſe deepe waters; pull body out; yea, pull ſoule out, and ſave the heart when it is overwhelmed.</p>
               <p>The worſt evill is curable, the greateſt good attainable, I ſee by this point. The greateſt good in this world, is that which Chriſt moſt loves; that which he moſt loves, is <hi>truth in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts.</hi> Wee are taken with outward beauty, and outward glory; Chriſt is not. All the glory of this world was ſhewed to him by ſatan, at once, and yet no temptation to him, affection not ſtird a jot; internall glory takes Chriſt much, truth in the heart; himſelfe ſeated in the ſoule, is the greateſt good in the world, to him, and to us; and this takes him exceedingly. If the Divell when hee tooke Chriſt and ſet him upon the top of a high place, could have taken Chriſt and ſet him downe in any mans heart, and ſeated truth in the inward parts of any one, though it had been the pooreſt perſon in the world; this would have taken him indeed: but Satan cannot doe this for Chriſt, neither doth Chriſt need it from him, he can doe it himſelfe; he works inwardly, at a greater depth, and from a more underived ſtrength then he; hee can take Chariot in his Word, and ride over all the great world, over all the little world, into every roome of the ſoule; into joynts and marrow, and ſet downe himſelfe where he will; in conſcience, in affection, in what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part he ſees good; in ſome one part, or in all parts: that is the greateſt good in the world, when truth is in the inward <hi>[parts]</hi> (i.) not in one faculty, but in all; not onely in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, but in the conſcience, in the affection, in every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; this Chriſt loves mightily, and what hee loves hee can accompliſh; there is no torture upon him, affection larger then power, as tis uſually with us. <hi>All power is given to him,</hi> to worke
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:113418:249"/>
without, to worke within, in Earth, in Heaven; that is, in the more internall and heavenly part. Hee giveth wiſdome <hi>to the heart. I will give my Lawes into your mind.</hi> By Lawes is meant all grace; and yet all this made a gift, and given into the ſoule that deſires it. Chriſt gives things into the hand, yea, into the heart, all precious things, and derives them into all parts; and when all this is done in us, and the like laboured for to be done by us, in all others; then is internall operation in <hi>power;</hi> or then Chriſt workes in us <hi>mightily;</hi> which terme pointing onely at a gradation in the ſame operation, hath raveld out it ſelfe, according to what is difficult, in unfolding the former.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>WHich worketh in me mightily</hi>] The concurrence of this power wee have had in our meaſure all along our labour, which I would ſhould be much acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to Chriſt; by vertue of which wee are now come to our period of this Verſe, and of the whole Chapter. Our pace in this long journey hath been ſlow, that you might all goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with mee, in the well underſtanding and imbracing of weighty things; and yet how many notwithſtanding our double induſtry are left behind, in the blindneſſe and miſ-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of their ſoules, I know not. If our Goſpell be hid, after all pains fully to lay it open, ſuch ſoules have great reaſon to feare themſelves. Child-bearing is no eaſie worke to any, but dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hard to ſome; ſo that life out of death, may that which comes forth betweene the legges, be called. This birth though but a hard-favoured child, hath beene hard travell to us; 'tas made many a ſigh and groane, many a heart pang and crying out to God. What you will doe with the child now borne, whither you will be a <hi>Pharaoh</hi> or a <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Daughter to
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:113418:249"/>
it, murther it or keepe it alive in your hearts, I know not. This I know, that no man can ſpill all the blood of any child of God, ſome will ſtick upon you doe what you can, to tell the murtherer at the great day. Sighes and groanes are the teares of the heart, the heart venting it ſelfe at the mouth when it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not at the eyes and other leſſer pores: every drop that hath fallen from our heart and head, from our Eye-lids or Eye-brows ſhall be all gathered up, and put as marginall notes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by all our labours, and all put in one Volumne together; and this volumne put in your hand at the great day, and opened Leafe after Leafe, and read diſtinctly and exactly to you, and your ſoules made to attend, regard, and remember better then here many of you have done; and when all is thus read over, this booke ſhall be cloſed, and this queſtion ſolemnly put to you all; now O ſoules, what have you profitted by all Words, Prayers, Teares, Sighes, Groanes? As Conſcience can an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this (for nothing elſe may then ſpeake,) ſo ſhall your ſentence be, and I ſhall be called out to give witneſſe to the juſtice of it, and ſay Amen Lord Jeſus, righteous is all that thou haſt pronounced upon theſe ſoules. Our labours loſt, if this were ſimply all, truly 'twere nothing; but our labours loſt, and your ſoules are loſt; and yet what is loſſe to you ſhall be gaine to us, for wee are a ſweete ſavour to God both in them that are ſaved and in them that periſh. As wee dreſſe and as wee water Trees in the Lords Vinyard, ſo ſhall wee have our wages, and not as theſe Trees beare; if Trees be dreſſed and watered well, though they never beare well, wee ſhall have a good Vintage. You Londoners are Trees wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red choiſely indeede. 'Tis ſtoried of the Plane Tree, that at its firſt tranſplanting into Italie, 'twas watered with Wine, to make it take and proſper in thoſe parts of the World: you are Trees watered with Wine; I cannot ſay that you have beene ſo watered by mee, I dare not; but this I can humbly and truly ſay, that if our choiſeſt ſtrength and ſpirits, may bee nam'd in ſteade of Water, Wine, or if the bleſſing which hath gone along with theſe Waters at any time have turned them into Wine, in vigour upon your ſoules, then hath God
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:113418:250"/>
by mee watered your Rootes with Wine; and yet if after ſuch coſtly watering you grow not nor beare not, certainly ſuch Trees are neere unto curſing; which ſad effect that my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtey ſhould be an inſtrument to haſten to this place, or to any ſoule, will make mee to continue mourning ſtill in ſecret for you all, and ſo ſpend and end my dayes. <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g>
